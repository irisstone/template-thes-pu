\textbf{Chapter 2} \\
First and foremost, I would like to thank my co-first author on the manuscript, Scott Bolkan, for his invaluable contributions to this project. He and Ilana conceived of the experimental work, and he performed all of the experiments and conducted substantial subsequent analysis on that data. The results of his efforts are reflected in the paper primarily in Sections \ref{sec:glmhmm:2.2.1} through \ref{sec:glmhmm:2.2.5}, in main Figures \ref{fig:glmhmm:1} through \ref{fig:glmhmm:3}, and in additional Figures \ref{fig:ap1:ext1}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp1}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp2}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext2}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp3}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext3}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext4}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext5}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext6}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext10}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp5}, and \ref{fig:ap1:supp6}. I also thank him for being a wonderful person to work with and a very supportive teammate; that support was crucial in my early years of graduate school. I also thank my other co-authors, the entire BRAINCoGs team, and the Pillow and Witten Labs for their feedback on the work, as well as the reviewers at \textit{Nature Neuroscience} for their helpful comments. \\
\textbf{Chapter 3} \\
As a computational neuroscientist, none of my work would be possible without the help of intrepid experimentalists who spend copious hours collecting data for me to explore. I am therefore endlessly grateful to Victoria Corbit, who designed the experimental setup, built the linear track chamber, collected all the video recordings, and performed the SLEAP keypoint labeling as described in Section \ref{sec:slds:3.2.1} and Figure \ref{fig:slds:1}. She was also a strong source of moral support and a great friend and teammate in the time that we worked together. I also acknowledge the support of Anna Zhukovskaya and Lindsay Willmore, who had their own projects studying naturalistic behavior in the Witten lab and offered me their insights, literature recommendations, and inspiration along the way. \\
\textbf{Chapter 4} \\
For this portion of my PhD work, I offer a huge round of acknowledgement to my co-first author Yotam Sagiv. Remember when we thought this would be a course project? What a special experience to work so closely on a paper with such a good friend; those early days of Sunday meetings, while occasionally painful, I will carry with me for a long time as fond memories and a winning example of theorists collaborating well. Those meetings blended into day-long, unusually successful pair-programming sessions where we seemed to act as if one mind in two bodies. The road to the end was yet still long, but I am both proud and relieved that we got there. I also thank my other co-authors Jonathan and Memming  as well as the reviewers at \textit{TMLR} for their helpful comments (and the reviewers at \textit{NeurIPS} and \textit{ICML} before that, for their... sometimes helpful comments). \\
