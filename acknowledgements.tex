First and foremost, I would like to thank my co-first author on the manuscript, Scott Bolkan, for his invaluable contributions to this project. He and Ilana conceived of the experimental work, and he performed all of the experiments and conducted substantial subsequent analysis on that data. The results of his efforts are reflected in the paper primarily in results sections \ref{sec:glmhmm:2.2.1} through \ref{sec:glmhmm:2.2.1}, in main figures \ref{fig:glmhmm:1} through \ref{fig:glmhmm:3}, and in additional figures \ref{fig:ap1:ext1}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp1}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp2}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext2}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp3}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext3}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext4}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext5}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext6}, \ref{fig:ap1:ext10}, \ref{fig:ap1:supp5}, and \ref{fig:ap1:supp6}. I also thank him for being a wonderful person to work with and the best teammate I could have asked for in my early years of graduate school. He set the standard for what I searched for (and will continue searching for) in future collaborations with experimentalists. I also thank my other co-authors, the entire BRAINCoGs team, and the Pillow and Witten Labs for their feedback on the work, as well as the reviewers at Nature Neuroscience for their helpful comments. \\
