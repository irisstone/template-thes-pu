Our findings indicate that the opposing contributions of DMS pathways to movement are minimal in the absence of a decision (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:1}), while the pathways provide large and opponent contributions to decision-making. Moreover, this contribution depends on the demands of a task (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:2}), as the effect of inhibition is much larger during decisions that require evidence accumulation relative to control tasks with weaker cognitive requirements yet similar sensory features and motor requirements (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:3}). The GLMâ€“HMM further revealed that even within the evidence accumulation task, the contribution of DMS pathways to choice is not fixed. For example, DMS pathways have little contribution when mice pursue a strategy of repeating previous choices during the evidence accumulation task (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:6}). Thus, together our findings imply that opposing contributions of DMS pathways to behavior are dependent on task demands and internal state.
