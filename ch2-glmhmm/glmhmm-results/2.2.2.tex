(e) Schematic of head-fixation of mice in a virtual reality (VR) apparatus allowing 2-D navigation. Displacements of an air-suspended spherical ball in the anterior-posterior (and medial-lateral) axes of the mouse controlled y- (and x-) position movements in a visual VR environment. (f) Schematic of virtual corridor 6-cm in width and 330-cm in length, consisting of a start region (-10-0cm), an inhibition region (0-200cm) in which mice received unilateral 532-nm light on a random subset of trials (30\%), a reward location (310cm) where mice received reward, and a teleportation location (320cm) where mice were transported to the start region following a variable ITI with mean of 2-s.

To determine if endogenous activity in DMS pathways provides bidirectional control of motor output in the absence of a decision, we carried out unilateral inhibition of indirect and direct pathways in head-fixed mice running on an air-supported ball to traverse a 2-dimensional linear corridor in virtual reality (VR) (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:1}d-f, 6-cm x 330-cm corridor). Illumination of the DMS was restricted to 0-200cm (laser on 30\% of trials; hemisphere of illumination alternated across days). The parameters of the virtual corridor and inhibition period were selected to closely match the stem of the VR-based T-maze decision-making tasks that are the focus of subsequent experiments.

We found no detectable impact of pathway-specific DMS inhibition, nor DMS illumination alone, on multiple indicators of motor output during virtual corridor navigation. This included measures of velocity, x-position or view angle relative to the laser hemisphere, and distance traveled (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:1}g-j; see Extended Data Fig. \ref{fig:ap1:ext2} for additional measures). Similarly, we obtained null effects of pathway-specific inhibition on velocity (and spatial preference) in freely behaving mice in a conditioned place preference assay (Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:ap1:supp3}). 

These negative findings argue against a major involvement of endogenous activity in DMS pathways in the execution of movement in the absence of a decision. This is consistent with the dearth of reports demonstrating strong and opposing modulation of behavior by striatal pathways using pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition.
