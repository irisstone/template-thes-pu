\subsection{GLM–HMM better explains choice data with dorsomedial striatum inhibition}
\label{sec:glmhmm:2.2.7}

The standard GLM describes choice as depending on a fixed linear combination of sensory evidence, trial history and the presence or absence of optical inhibition. However, an alternative possibility is that mice use a weighting function that varies over time. To test this idea, we adopted a latent state model with different GLM weights for different states (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:4}). The model consists of a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Bernoulli GLM observations, or GLM–HMM \cite{bengio_input_1994,escola_hidden_2011,calhoun_unsupervised_2019,ashwood_mice_2022} (Fig. 5a,b). Each hidden state is associated with a unique set of GLM weights governing choice behavior in that state. Probabilistic transitions between states occur after every trial, governed by a fixed matrix of transition probabilities (\ref{sec:appendix1:methods}).

On each trial, the latent state defines which GLM weights map inputs ($\Delta$ cues, laser, previous choice, and previous rewarded choice) to the probability of choosing right or left. The transition probability P governs the probability of changing states between trials. See \ref{sec:appendix1:methods} for information on how the inputs were coded. (b) Schematic of GLM-HMM.

The GLM–HMM explained the choice data in the evidence accumulation task better than the GLM across multiple measures. To compare models, we computed the test log-likelihood of each animal’s data using cross-validation with held-out sessions (three-state GLM–HMM in Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:5}; see Extended Data Fig. \ref{fig:ap1:ext7}a–e and \ref{sec:ap1:m10} for more information on model selection). The three-state GLM–HMM achieved an average of a 6.2 bits per session (bps) increase in log-likelihood, making an average session $\sim$76 times more likely under the GLM–HMM (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:5}c). Furthermore, the GLM–HMM correctly predicted choice on held-out data more often than the GLM, especially on laser trials (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:5}d; average improvement across mice of 1.6\% on all trials, 3.5\% on trials with optical inhibition and 4.1\% on trials with optical inhibition when considering only mice with at least 100 inhibition trials).

Most interestingly, the GLM–HMM was better able to capture the temporal structure in the effect of inhibition on choice. Specifically, the choice data contained long runs in which choice was consistent with the bias direction predicted by pathway-specific inhibition (‘laser’), a feature which GLM–HMM simulations recapitulated, but GLM simulations did not (Fig. \ref{fig:glmhmm:5}e,f). Thus, taken together, the GLM–HMM provided a better model of the choice data than a standard GLM, particularly on trials with pathway-specific DMS inhibition.
