\subsection{Subspace identification recovers LDS parameters and provides good EM initializations in simulated data}
\label{sec:slds:3.2.5}

While the sLDS offers clear performance benefits over the AR-HMM, one significant drawback is the greater time and compute requirements needed to fit sLDS models. This is primarily due to the increase in the dimensionality of the parameter space, given the additional layer of (often high-dimensional) continuous latents as well as the need to jointly infer the discrete and continuous state sequences. Here, we provide a framework for an approach that can greatly speed up sLDS fitting time. This framework is founded on a mathematical concept called subspace identification (SSID) \cite{ho_editorial_1966, van_overschee_n4sid_1994, viberg_subspace-based_1995, van_overschee_subspace_1996}, which aims to...
