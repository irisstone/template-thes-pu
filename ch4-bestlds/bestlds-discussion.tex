We have presented a spectral estimator for driven Bernoulli latent linear dynamical systems. On a variety of simulated datasets, bestLDS returns consistent, high-quality estimates of the generative parameters efficiently on its own and also as an initializer for the expectation-maximization algorithm. Estimates are particularly robust in the large data, high-dimensional regime, which is an especially desirable use case of the model given the potential time-savings in fitting. One notable limitation of the method is that accuracy of the estimates may suffer in low-dimensional regimes where the number of observations is smaller than the number of latent dimensions, however we show in Section~\ref{sec:bestlds:results:4.3} that predictive performance is still strong and the returned estimates yield novel scientific insights, in addition to the significant time-savings over traditional inference methods (i.e. EM). These results can then inform subsequent analyses and model fitting procedures that require longer compute time (e.g., an assessment of the optimal number of latent dimensions and the importance of different inputs on the latent dynamics). Identifying the system matrices in the continuous state case may also provide relevant information for discrete state-space models. This would be another interesting area of future work, given the popularity of such models of behavior in neuroscience \cite{bolkan_opponent_2022, ashwood_mice_2022}. 

In the extremely-high dimensional regime, the primary limitation is the need to numerically infer the moments of $z$. Since the number of parameters increases as $O\big((kq)^2\big)$, time spent on moment conversion grows quickly with the dimensionality of the data. However, the compute time required for moment conversion is unlikely to negate the time-savings garnered from faster EM convergence. 

In sum, bestLDS proves an efficient estimator for driven Bernoulli-LDS data. Parameter recovery even without EM is efficient and accurate, potentially averting the need to spend time running iterations of expensive search algorithms. Coupled with EM, the method greatly speeds convergence of the final estimate, even in cases where normality of the inputs is violated. Binary time-series data arise in many contexts, including reinforcement learning and decision-making, weather outcomes, finance, and neuroscience. We thus expect that bestLDS will be broadly useful to practitioners looking to quickly acquire a description of the latent dynamics underlying these systems.
