This interest is due to the ability of providing accurate state-space models for multivariable linear systems directly from input-output data. The methods have their origin in classical state-space realization theory as developed in the 1960s. The main computational tools are the QR and the singular-value decompositions. Here, an overview of existing subspace-based techniques for system identification is given. The methods are grouped into the classes of realization-based and direct techniques. Similarities between different algorithms are pointed out, and their applicability is commented upon. We also discuss some recent ideas for improving and extending the methods. A simulation example is included for comparing different algorithms. The subspace-based approach is found to perform competitive with respect to prediction-error methods, provided the system is properly excited.},

These state sequences are shown to be outputs of non-steady state Kalman filter banks. From these it is easy to determine the state space system matrices. The N4SID algorithms are always convergent (non-iterative) and numerically stable since they only make use of QR and Singular Value Decompositions. Both N4SID algorithms are similar, but the second one trades off accuracy for simplicity. These new algorithms are compared with existing subspace algorithms in theory and in practice.},

While most representations ignore words' local context, a natural way to induce context-dependent representations is to perform inference in a probabilistic latent-variable sequence model. Given the recent success of continuous vector space word representations, we provide such an inference procedure for continuous states, where words' representations are given by the posterior mean of a linear dynamical system. Here, efficient inference can be performed using Kalman filtering. Our learning algorithm is extremely scalable, operating on simple cooccurrence counts for both parameter initialization using the method of moments and subsequent iterations of EM. In our experiments, we employ our inferred word embeddings as features in standard tagging tasks, obtaining significant accuracy improvements. Finally, the Kalman filter updates can be seen as a linear recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that using the parameters of our model to initialize a non-linear recurrent neural network language model reduces its training time by a day and yields lower perplexity.},

Although tensor decompositions are generally intractable to compute, the decomposition of these specially structured tensors can be efficiently obtained by a variety of approaches, including power iterations and maximization approaches (similar to the case of matrices). A detailed analysis of a robust tensor power method is provided, establishing an analogue of Wedin's perturbation theorem for the singular vectors of matrices.

Here, we present an unsupervised probabilistic deep learning framework that identifies behavioral structure from deep variational embeddings of animal motion (VAME). By using a mouse model of beta amyloidosis as a use case, we show that VAME not only identifies discrete behavioral motifs, but also captures a hierarchical representation of the motif’s usage. The approach allows for the grouping of motifs into communities and the detection of differences in community-specific motif usage of individual mouse cohorts that were undetectable by human visual observation. Thus, we present a robust approach for the segmentation of animal motion that is applicable to a wide range of experimental setups, models and conditions without requiring supervised or a-priori human interference.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive behavioral tracking of animals is crucial for many scientific investigations. Recent transfer learning approaches for behavioral tracking have considerably advanced the state of the art. Typically these methods treat each video frame and each object to be tracked independently. In this work, we improve on these methods (particularly in the regime of few training labels) by leveraging  the rich spatiotemporal structures pervasive in behavioral video --- specifically, the spatial statistics imposed by physical constraints (e.g., paw to elbow distance), and the temporal statistics imposed by smoothness from frame to frame. We propose a probabilistic graphical model built on top of deep neural networks, Deep Graph Pose (DGP), to leverage these useful spatial and temporal constraints, and develop an efficient structured variational approach to perform inference in this model.  The resulting semi-supervised model exploits both labeled and unlabeled frames to achieve significantly more accurate and robust tracking while requiring users to label fewer training frames.  In turn, these tracking improvements enhance performance on downstream applications, including robust unsupervised segmentation of behavioral syllables,'' and estimation of interpretabledisentangled''  low-dimensional representations of the full behavioral video.

While advances in deep learning and computer vision have enabled markerless pose estimation in individual animals, extending these to multiple animals presents unique challenges for studies of social behaviors or animals in their natural environments. Here we present Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP), a machine learning system for multi-animal pose tracking. This system enables versatile workflows for data labeling, model training and inference on previously unseen data. SLEAP features an accessible graphical user interface, a standardized data model, a reproducible configuration system, over 30 model architectures, two approaches to part grouping and two approaches to identity tracking. We applied SLEAP to seven datasets across flies, bees, mice and gerbils to systematically evaluate each approach and architecture, and we compare it with other existing approaches. SLEAP achieves greater accuracy and speeds of more than 800 frames per second, with latencies of less than 3.5 ms at full 1,024 × 1,024 image resolution. This makes SLEAP usable for real-time applications, which we demonstrate by controlling the behavior of one animal on the basis of the tracking and detection of social interactions with another animal.},

	abstract = {Videos of animal behavior are used to quantify researcher-defined behaviors of interest to study neural function, gene mutations, and pharmacological therapies. Behaviors of interest are often scored manually, which is time-consuming, limited to few behaviors, and variable across researchers. We created DeepEthogram: software that uses supervised machine learning to convert raw video pixels into an ethogram, the behaviors of interest present in each video frame. DeepEthogram is designed to be general-purpose and applicable across species, behaviors, and video-recording hardware. It uses convolutional neural networks to compute motion, extract features from motion and images, and classify features into behaviors. Behaviors are classified with above 90\% accuracy on single frames in videos of mice and flies, matching expert-level human performance. DeepEthogram accurately predicts rare behaviors, requires little training data, and generalizes across subjects. A graphical interface allows beginning-to-end analysis without end-user programming. DeepEthogram’s rapid, automatic, and reproducible labeling of researcher-defined behaviors of interest may accelerate and enhance supervised behavior analysis.

State-of-the-art deep-learning methods offer major advances in data quality and detail by allowing researchers to automatically estimate locations of an animal’s body parts directly from images or videos. However, currently available animal pose estimation methods have limitations in speed and robustness. Here, we introduce a new easy-to-use software toolkit, DeepPoseKit, that addresses these problems using an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model, called Stacked DenseNet, and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for estimating keypoint locations with subpixel precision. These advances improve processing speed {\textgreater}2x with no loss in accuracy compared to currently available methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our methods with multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings—including groups of interacting individuals.

Therefore, we designed DANNCE to robustly track anatomical landmarks in 3D across species and behaviors. DANNCE uses projective geometry to construct inputs to a convolutional neural network that leverages learned 3D geometric reasoning. We trained and benchmarked DANNCE using a dataset of nearly seven million frames that relates color videos and rodent 3D poses. In rats and mice, DANNCE robustly tracked dozens of landmarks on the head, trunk, and limbs of freely moving animals in naturalistic settings. We extended DANNCE to datasets from rat pups, marmosets, and chickadees, and demonstrate quantitative profiling of behavioral lineage during development.},

Starting from the observation that behaving agents are generally the main sources of movement in behavioral videos, our method, Behavioral Keypoint Discovery (B-KinD), uses an encoder-decoder architecture with a geometric bottleneck to reconstruct the spatiotemporal difference between video frames. By focusing only on regions of movement, our approach works directly on input videos without requiring manual annotations. Experiments on a variety of agent types (mouse, fly, human, jellyfish, and trees) demonstrate the generality of our approach and reveal that our discovered keypoints represent semantically meaningful body parts, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on key-point regression among self-supervised methods. Additionally, B-KinD achieve comparable performance to supervised keypoints on downstream tasks, such as behavior classification, suggesting that our method can dramatically reduce model training costs vis-a-vis supervised methods.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous mouse behavior is composed from repeatedly-used modules of movement (e.g., rearing, running, grooming) that are flexibly placed into sequences whose content evolves over time. By identifying behavioral modules and the order in which they are expressed, researchers can gain insight into the impact of drugs, genes, context, sensory stimuli and neural activity on behavior. Here we present a protocol for performing Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), an ethologically-inspired method that uses 3D machine vision and unsupervised machine learning to decompose spontaneous mouse behavior in the laboratory into a series of elemental modules called"syllables". This protocol is based upon a notebook-based pipeline for MoSeq that includes modules for depth video acquisition, data pre-processing and modeling, as well as a standardized set of visualization tools. Users are provided with instructions and code for building a MoSeq imaging rig and acquiring three-dimensional video of spontaneous mouse behavior for submission to the modeling framework; the outputs of this protocol include syllable labels for each frame of video data as well as summary plots describing how often each syllable was used and how syllables transitioned from one to the other over time. This protocol and the accompanying pipeline significantly lower the bar for adopting this unsupervised, data-driven approach to characterizing mouse behavior, enabling users without significant computational ethology experience to gain insight into how the structure of behavior is altered after experimental manipulations.},

Behavior has traditionally been characterized by low-dimensional, task-related variables such as movement speed or response times. More recently, there has been a growing interest in automated analysis of high-dimensional video data collected during experiments. Here we introduce a probabilistic framework for the analysis of behavioral video and neural activity. This framework provides tools for compression, segmentation, generation, and decoding of behavioral videos. Compression is performed using a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which yields a low-dimensional continuous representation of behavior. We then use an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) to segment the CAE representation into discrete "behavioral syllables." The resulting generative model can be used to simulate behavioral video data. Finally, based on this generative model, we develop a novel Bayesian decoding approach that takes in neural activity and outputs probabilistic estimates of the full-resolution behavioral video. We demonstrate this framework on two different experimental paradigms using distinct behavioral and neural recording technologies.},

The architecture is designed to jointly learn part locations and their association via two branches of the same sequential prediction process.

Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, remains unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum depends on the cognitive requirements of a task. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden Markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that—even within a single task—the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the demands imposed by a task, as well as the internal state of mice when performing a task, determine whether dorsomedial striatum pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Examples of ‘traditional’ latent variable models include latent class models, item–response models, common factor models, structural equation models, mixed or random effects models and covariate measurement error models. Although latent variables have widely different interpretations in different settings, the models have a very similar mathematical structure. This has been the impetus for the formulation of general modelling frameworks which accommodate a wide range of models. Recent developments include multilevel structural equation models with both continuous and discrete latent variables, multiprocess models and nonlinear latent variable models.},

Using traditional structural equation modeling as a starting point, it shows how the idea of latent variables captures a wide variety of statistical concepts, including random effects, missing data, sources of variation in hierarchical data, finite mixtures. latent classes, and clusters. These latent variable applications go beyond the traditional latent variable useage in psychometrics with its focus on measurement error and hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators. The article argues for the value of integrating statistical and psychometric modeling ideas. Different applications are discussed in a unifying framework that brings together in one general model such different analysis types as factor models, growth curve models, multilevel models, latent class models and discrete-time survival models. Several possible combinations and extensions of these models are made clear due to the unifying framework.},

Using a series of examples, I make the case that behavior is often more useful than neuroscientific measurements for answering the first question. Moreover, I show that even for "how" questions that pertain to neural mechanism, a well-crafted behavioral paradigm can offer deeper insight and stronger constraints on computational and mechanistic models than do many highly challenging (and very expensive) neural studies. I conclude that purely behavioral research is essential for understanding the brain-especially its cognitive functions-contrary to the opinion of prominent funding bodies and some scientific journals, who erroneously place neural data on a pedestal and consider behavior to be subsidiary.

This has opened up a new field of computational ethology and will, in the near future, make it possible to quantify in near completeness what an animal is doing as it navigates its environment. The importance of improving the techniques with which we characterize behavior is reflected in the emerging recognition that understanding behavior is an essential (or even prerequisite) step to pursuing neuroscience questions. The use of these methods, however, is not limited to studying behavior in the wild or in strictly ethological settings. Modern tools for behavioral quantification can be applied to the full gamut of approaches that have historically been used to link brain to behavior, from psychophysics to cognitive tasks, augmenting those measurements with rich descriptions of how animals navigate those tasks. Here we review recent technical advances in quantifying behavior, particularly in methods for tracking animal motion and characterizing the structure of those dynamics. We discuss open challenges that remain for behavioral quantification and highlight promising future directions, with a strong emphasis on emerging approaches in deep learning, the core technology that has enabled the markedly rapid pace of progress of this field. We then discuss how quantitative descriptions of behavior can be leveraged to connect brain activity with animal movements, with the ultimate goal of resolving the relationship between neural circuits, cognitive processes and behavior.},

Here we present new analyses suggesting that this common view is incorrect. We analyzed data from mouse and human decision-making experiments and found that choice behavior relies on an interplay among multiple interleaved strategies. These strategies, characterized by states in a hidden Markov model, persist for tens to hundreds of trials before switching, and often switch multiple times within a session. The identified decision-making strategies were highly consistent across mice and comprised a single ‘engaged’ state, in which decisions relied heavily on the sensory stimulus, and several biased states in which errors frequently occurred. These results provide a powerful alternate explanation for ‘lapses’ often observed in rodent behavioral experiments, and suggest that standard measures of performance mask the presence of major changes in strategy across trials.},

However, little is known about the spatiotemporal organization of this activity. We investigated the spatiotemporal organization of SPN ensemble activity in mice during self-paced, natural movements using microendoscopic imaging. Activity in both pathways showed predominantly local but also some long-range correlations. Using a novel approach to cluster and quantify behaviors based on continuous accelerometer and video data, we found that SPN ensembles active during specific actions were spatially closer and more correlated overall. Furthermore, similarity between different actions corresponded to the similarity between SPN ensemble patterns, irrespective of movement speed. Consistently, the accuracy of decoding behavior from SPN ensemble patterns was directly related to the dissimilarity between behavioral clusters. These results identify a predominantly local, but not spatially compact, organization of direct- and indirect-pathway SPN activity that maps action space independently of movement speed.,

	abstract = {The cortico–basal ganglia–thalamo–cortical loop is one of the fundamental network motifs in the brain. Revealing its structural and functional organization is critical to understanding cognition, sensorimotor behaviour, and the natural history of many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Classically, this network is conceptualized to contain three information channels: motor, limbic and associative1–4. Yet this three-channel view cannot explain the myriad functions of the basal ganglia. We previously subdivided the dorsal striatum into 29 functional domains on the basis of the topography of inputs from the entire cortex5. Here we map the multi-synaptic output pathways of these striatal domains through the globus pallidus external part (GPe), substantia nigra reticular part (SNr), thalamic nuclei and cortex. Accordingly, we identify 14 SNr and 36 GPe domains and a direct cortico-SNr projection. The striatonigral direct pathway displays a greater convergence of striatal inputs than the more parallel striatopallidal indirect pathway, although direct and indirect pathways originating from the same striatal domain ultimately converge onto the same postsynaptic SNr neurons. Following the SNr outputs, we delineate six domains in the parafascicular and ventromedial thalamic nuclei. Subsequently, we identify six parallel cortico–basal ganglia–thalamic subnetworks that sequentially transduce specific subsets of cortical information through every elemental node of the cortico–basal ganglia–thalamic loop. Thalamic domains relay this output back to the originating corticostriatal neurons of each subnetwork in a bona fide closed loop.},

To account for the variety of clinical manifestations associated with insults to various parts of the basal ganglia we propose a model in which specific types of basal ganglia disorders are associated with changes in the function of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons. This model is based on a synthesis of experimental animal and post-mortem human anatomic and neurochemical data. Hyperkinetic disorders, which are characterized by an excess of abnormal movements, are postulated to result from the selective impairment of striatal neurons projecting to the lateral globus pallidus. Hypokinetic disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, are hypothesized to result from a complex series of changes in the activity of striatal projection neuron subpopulations resulting in an increase in basal ganglia output. This model suggests that the activity of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons is differentially regulated by striatal afferents and that different striatal projection neuron subpopulations may mediate different aspects of motor control.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia comprise several nuclei in the forebrain, diencephalon, and midbrain thought to play a significant role in the control of posture and movement. It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases of the basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abnormal body postures, slowing of movement, involuntary movements, or a combination of these abnormalities. However, it has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia contribute to normal movement. Recent advances in knowledge of the basal ganglia circuitry, activity of basal ganglia neurons during movement, and the effect of basal ganglia lesions have led to a new hypothesis of basal ganglia function. The hypothesis states that the basal ganglia do not generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement is generated by cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms, the basal ganglia act broadly to inhibit competing motor mechanisms that would otherwise interfere with the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability to inhibit competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal postures and involuntary muscle activity. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Here we show that the number of required cortical areas and their dynamics vary across related tasks with different cognitive computations. In a visually guided virtual T-maze task, bilateral inactivation of only a few dorsal cortical regions impaired performance. In contrast, in tasks requiring evidence accumulation and/or post-stimulus memory, performance was impaired by inactivation of widespread cortical areas with diverse patterns of behavioral deﬁcits across areas and tasks. Wideﬁeld imaging revealed widespread ramps of Ca2+ activity during the accumulation and visually guided tasks. Additionally, during accumulation, different regions had more diverse activity proﬁles, leading to reduced inter-area correlations. Using a modular recurrent neural network model trained to perform analogous tasks, we argue that differences in computational strategies alone could explain these ﬁndings.},

With optic fibres placed in the sensorimotor striatum, an area known to contain movement velocity-related single units, photo-stimulation reliably produced movements that could be precisely quantified with our motion capture programme. A single light pulse was sufficient to elicit movements with short latencies ({\textless}30 ms). Increasing stimulation frequency increased movement speed, with a highly linear relationship.

Although the basal ganglia have been implicated in these processes1–5, the circuit mechanisms underlying action selection and exploration remain unclear. Here, using a simple lateralized licking task, we show that indirect striatal projection neurons (iSPN) in the basal ganglia contribute to these processes through modulation of the superior colliculus (SC). Optogenetic activation of iSPNs suppresses contraversive licking and promotes ipsiversive licking. Activity in lateral superior colliculus (lSC), a region downstream of the basal ganglia, is necessary for task performance and predicts lick direction. Furthermore, iSPN activation suppresses ipsilateral lSC, but surprisingly excites contralateral lSC, explaining the emergence of ipsiversive licking. Optogenetic inactivation reveals inter-collicular competition whereby each hemisphere of the superior colliculus inhibits the other, thus allowing the indirect pathway to disinhibit the contralateral lSC and trigger licking. Finally, inactivating iSPNs impairs suppression of devalued but previously rewarded licking and reduces exploratory licking. Our results reveal that iSPNs engage the competitive interaction between lSC hemispheres to trigger a motor action and suggest a general circuit mechanism for exploration during action selection.},

From this review, we propose that, along with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the striatum primarily supports cognitive control of memory retrieval. We conclude by proposing three hypotheses for the specific role of striatum in retrieval: (1) Striatum modulates the re-encoding of retrieved items in accord with their expected utility (adaptive encoding), (2) striatum selectively admits information into working memory that is expected to increase the likelihood of successful retrieval (adaptive gating), and (3) striatum enacts adjustments in cognitive control based on the outcome of retrieval (reinforcement learning).},

	abstract = {Summary
          Imbalance between action suppression and production characterizes several basal ganglia (BG) disorders. Relatedly, the direct and indirect pathways of the BG are hypothesized to promote and suppress actions, respectively. Yet striatal direct (dMSNs) and indirect (iMSNs) medium spiny neurons are coactive around movement, apparently contradicting direct-indirect functional opponency. In the dorsolateral striatum of mice, we observed coactivation around movements, but elevated and diminished activity of iMSNs and dMSNs, respectively, during action suppression. Furthermore, relative activity of the two hemispheres evolved in opposite directions in the two pathways as the need to suppress movements to either side of the body developed over time. Lastly, optogenetic inhibition experiments revealed the necessity of iMSNs but not dMSNs for the proactive suppression of specific actions, and dMSNs but not iMSNs for generalized action vigor. These data demonstrate distinct yet still broadly opponent roles for the direct and indirect pathways in behavioral control.},

Here we show that the relationship between activity in the cortex and striatum is spatiotemporally precise, topographic, causal and invariant to behaviour. We simultaneously recorded activity across large regions of the cortex and across the width of the dorsal striatum in mice that performed a visually guided task. Striatal activity followed a mediolateral gradient in which behavioural correlates progressed from visual cue to response movement to reward licking. The summed activity in each part of the striatum closely and specifically mirrored activity in topographically associated cortical regions, regardless of task engagement. This relationship held for medium spiny neurons and fast-spiking interneurons, whereas the activity of tonically active neurons differed from cortical activity with stereotypical responses to sensory or reward events. Inactivation of the visual cortex abolished striatal responses to visual stimuli, supporting a causal role of cortical inputs in driving the striatum. Striatal visual responses were larger in trained mice than untrained mice, with no corresponding change in overall activity in the visual cortex. Striatal activity therefore reflects a consistent, causal and scalable topographical mapping of cortical activity.},

Striatal responses to cortical inputs, however, can be affected by changes in connection strength$^{\textrm{13–15}}$, local striatal circuitry$^{\textrm{16,17}}$, and thalamic inputs$^{\textrm{18,19}}$. Therefore, it is unclear whether the pattern of activity across striatal domains mirrors that across the cortex$^{\textrm{20–23}}$ or differs from it$^{\textrm{24–28}}$. Here we use simultaneous large-scale recordings in the cortex and the striatum to show that striatal activity can be accurately predicted by spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cortex. The relationship between activity in the cortex and the striatum was spatially consistent with corticostriatal anatomy, and temporally consistent with a feedforward drive. Each striatal domain exhibited specific sensorimotor responses that predictably followed activity in the associated cortical regions, and the corticostriatal relationship remained unvaried during passive states or performance of a task probing visually guided behavior. However, the task’s visual stimuli and corresponding behavioral responses evoked relatively more activity in the striatum than in associated cortical regions. This increased striatal activity involved an additive offset in firing rate, which was independent of task engagement but only present in animals that had learned the task. Thus, striatal activity largely reflects patterns of cortical activity, deviating from them in a simple additive fashion for learned stimuli or actions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The stability of neural activity in the sensorimotor striatum is thought to underlie not only normal habits but also addiction and clinical syndromes characterized by behavioral fixity. By recording in the sensorimotor striatum of mice, we asked whether neuronal activity acquired during procedural learning would be stable even if the sensory stimuli triggering the habitual behavior were altered. Contrary to expectation, both fixed and flexible activity patterns appeared. One, representing the global structure of the acquired behavior, was stable across changes in task cuing. The second, a fine-grain representation of task events, adjusted rapidly. Such dual forms of representation may be critical to allow motor and cognitive flexibility despite habitual performance.},

	abstract = {There is increased appreciation that dopamine neurons in the midbrain respond not only to reward1 and reward-predicting cues1,2, but also to other variables such as the distance to reward3, movements4–9 and behavioural choices10,11. An important question is how the responses to these diverse variables are organized across the population of dopamine neurons. Whether individual dopamine neurons multiplex several variables, or whether there are subsets of neurons that are specialized in encoding specific behavioural variables remains unclear. This fundamental question has been difficult to resolve because recordings from large populations of individual dopamine neurons have not been performed in a behavioural task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. Here, to address this gap, we used two-photon calcium imaging through an implanted lens to record the activity of more than 300 dopamine neurons from the ventral tegmental area of the mouse midbrain during a complex decision-making task. As mice navigated in a virtual-reality environment, dopamine neurons encoded an array of sensory, motor and cognitive variables. These responses were functionally clustered, such that subpopulations of neurons transmitted information about a subset of behavioural variables, in addition to encoding reward. These functional clusters were spatially organized, with neighbouring neurons more likely to be part of the same cluster. Together with the topography between dopamine neurons and their projections, this specialization and anatomical organization may aid downstream circuits in correctly interpreting the wide range of signals transmitted by dopamine neurons.},

We recorded from excitatory neural populations in posterior cortices as mice performed a complex, dynamic task involving multiple interrelated variables. The neural encoding implied that highly correlated task variables were represented by less-correlated neural population modes, while pairs of neurons exhibited a spectrum of signal correlations. This finding relates to principles of efficient coding, but notably utilizes neural population modes as the encoding unit and suggests partial whitening of task-specific information where different variables are represented with different signal-to-noise levels. Remarkably, this encoding function was multiplexed with sequential neural dynamics yet reliably followed changes in task-variable correlations throughout the trial. We suggest that neural circuits can implement time-dependent encodings in a simple way using random sequential dynamics as a temporal scaffold.},

In this striatal model, neuronal population activity is assumed to encode locomotion relevant information. Here, we propose a novel encoding mechanism for the dorsal striatum. We identified spatially compact neural clusters in both the direct and indirect pathways. Detailed characterization revealed similar cluster organization between the direct and indirect pathways, and cluster activities from both pathways were correlated with mouse locomotion velocities. Using machine-learning algorithms, cluster activities could be used to decode locomotion relevant behavioral states and locomotion velocity. We propose that neural clusters in the dorsal striatum encode locomotion relevant information and that coordinated activities of direct and indirect pathway neural clusters are required for normal striatal controlled behavior.

We provide evidence that two regions of the rat striatum, ventral and dorsal, play distinct roles in instrumental conditioning (skill learning), with the ventral striatum being critical for learning and the dorsal striatum being important for performance but, notably, not for learning. This implies an actor (dorsal) versus director (ventral) division of labor, which is a new variant of the widely discussed actor-critic architecture. Our results also imply that the successful performance of a skill can ultimately result in its establishment as a habit outside the basal ganglia.},

Despite the importance of this DA innervation, it remains unclear whether and how DA neurons are specialized on the basis of the location of their striatal target. Thus, we sought to compare the function of subpopulations of DA neurons that target distinct striatal subregions in the context of an instrumental reversal learning task. We identified key differences in the encoding of reward and choice in dopamine terminals in dorsal versus ventral striatum: DA terminals in ventral striatum responded more strongly to reward consumption and reward-predicting cues, whereas DA terminals in dorsomedial striatum responded more strongly to contralateral choices. In both cases the terminals encoded a reward prediction error. Our results suggest that the DA modulation of the striatum is spatially organized to support the specialized function of the targeted subregion.},

Although critical to many striatal models, it is not clear whether these connections are random or whether they preferentially link functionally related groups of MSNs. To address this issue, dual whole patch-clamp recordings were made from striatal MSNs in brain slices taken from transgenic mice in which D1 or D2 dopamine receptor expression was reported with EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein). These studies revealed that unidirectional connections were common between both D1 receptor-expressing MSN (D1 MSN) pairs (26\%) and D2 receptor-expressing MSN (D2 MSN) pairs (36\%). D2 MSNs also commonly formed synapses on D1 MSNs (27\% of pairs). Conversely, only 6\% of the D1 MSNs formed detectable connections with D2 MSNs. Furthermore, synaptic connections formed by D1 MSNs were weaker than those formed by D2 MSNs, a difference that was attributable to fewer GABAA receptors at D1 MSN synapses. The strength of detectable recurrent connections was dramatically reduced in Parkinson's disease models. The studies demonstrate that recurrent collateral connections between MSNs are not random but rather differentially couple D1 and D2 MSNs. Moreover, this recurrent collateral network appears to be disrupted in Parkinson's disease models, potentially contributing to pathological alterations in MSN activity patterns and psychomotor symptoms.},

	abstract = {Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These "recurrent" switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable.},

However, it remains a challenge to model non-stationary interactions between high-dimensional populations of neurons. To tackle this challenge, we develop recurrent switching linear dynamical systems models for multiple populations. Here, each high-dimensional neural population is represented by a unique set of latent variables, which evolve dynamically in time. Populations interact with each other through this low-dimensional space. We allow the nature of these interactions to change over time by using a discrete set of dynamical states. Additionally, we parameterize these discrete state transition rules to capture which neural populations are responsible for switching between interaction states. To fit the model, we use variational expectation-maximization with a structured mean-field approximation. After validating the model on simulations, we apply it to two different neural datasets: spiking activity from motor areas in a non-human primate, and calcium imaging from neurons in the nematode C. elegans. In both datasets, the model reveals behaviorally-relevant discrete states with unique inter-population interactions and different populations that predict transitioning between these states.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits are exquisitely organized, consisting of many different neuronal subpopulations. However, it is difficult to assess the functional roles of these subpopulations using conventional extracellular recording techniques because these techniques do not easily distinguish spikes from different neuronal populations. To overcome this limitation, we have developed PINP (Photostimulation-assisted Identification of Neuronal Populations), a method of tagging neuronal populations for identification during in vivo electrophysiological recording. The method is based on expressing the light-activated channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to restricted neuronal subpopulations. ChR2-tagged neurons can be detected electrophysiologically in vivo since illumination of these neurons with a brief flash of blue light triggers a short latency reliable action potential. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique by expressing ChR2 in distinct populations of cortical neurons using two different strategies. First, we labeled a subpopulation of cortical neurons—mainly fast-spiking interneurons—by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver ChR2 in a transgenic mouse line in which the expression of Cre recombinase was driven by the parvalbumin promoter. Second, we labeled subpopulations of excitatory neurons in the rat auditory cortex with ChR2 based on projection target by using herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), which is efficiently taken up by axons and transported retrogradely; we find that this latter population responds to acoustic stimulation differently from unlabeled neurons. Tagging neurons is a novel application of ChR2, used in this case to monitor activity instead of manipulating it. PINP can be readily extended to other populations of genetically identifiable neurons, and will provide a useful method for probing the functional role of different neuronal populations in vivo.},

In this study, we addressed that role using a new method for identifying task-relevant dimensions of neural population activity. Specifically, we show that the PFC has a multidimensional code for context, decisions and both relevant and irrelevant sensory information. Moreover, these representations evolve in time, with an early linear accumulation phase followed by a phase with rotational dynamics. We identify the dimensions of neural activity associated with these phases and show that they do not arise from distinct populations but from a single population with broad tuning characteristics. Finally, we use model-based decoding to show that the transition from linear to rotational dynamics coincides with a plateau in decoding accuracy, revealing that rotational dynamics in the PFC preserve sensory choice information for the duration of the stimulus integration period.},

Alleviation of motor symptoms during STN stimulation can be accompanied by deterioration of abilities to quickly choose between conflicting alternatives. Cortical afferents to the subthalamic region (ST), comprising STN and zona incerta (ZI), include projections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), yet little is known about prefrontal-subthalamic coordination and its relevance for decision-making. Here we combined electrophysiological recordings with optogenetic manipulations of projections from mPFC to ST in mice as they performed a spatial working memory task (T-maze) or explored an elevated plus maze (anxiety test). We found that gamma oscillations (30–70 Hz) are coordinated between mPFC and ST at theta (5–10 Hz) and, less efficiently, at sub-theta (2–5 Hz) frequencies. An optogenetic detuning of the theta/gamma cross-frequency coupling between the regions into sub-theta range impaired performance in the T-maze, yet did not affect anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Both detuning and inhibition of the mPFC-ST pathway led to repeated incorrect choices in the T-maze. These effects were not associated with changes of anxiety and motor activity measures. Our findings suggest that action selection in a cognitively demanding task crucially involves theta rhythmic coordination of gamma oscillatory signaling in the prefrontal-subthalamic pathway.},

In addition to the defining motor symptoms of PD, multiple non-motor symptoms occur; among them, cognitive impairment is common and can potentially occur at any disease stage. Cognitive decline is usually slow and insidious, but rapid in some cases. Recently, the focus has been on the early cognitive changes, where executive and visuospatial impairments are typical and can be accompanied by memory impairment, increasing the risk for early progression to dementia. Other risk factors for early progression to dementia include visual hallucinations, older age and biomarker changes such as cortical atrophy, as well as Alzheimer-type changes on functional imaging and in cerebrospinal fluid, and slowing and frequency variation on EEG. However, the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in PD remain largely unclear. Cortical involvement of Lewy body and Alzheimer-type pathologies are key features, but multiple mechanisms are likely involved. Cholinesterase inhibition is the only high-level evidence-based treatment available, but other pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are being tested. Challenges include the identification of disease-modifying therapies as well as finding biomarkers to better predict cognitive decline and identify patients at high risk for early and rapid cognitive impairment.},

One subpopulation expresses D1-type dopamine receptors, another expresses D2-type receptors, and a third expresses both. The relative roles in NAc of D1 neurons versus D2 neurons in appetitive motivation were assessed here. Specifically, we asked whether D1-Cre mice would instrumentally seek optogenetic self-stimulation specifically targeted at D1 MSNs in NAc, and similarly if D2-Cre mice would self-stimulate D2 neurons in NAc. Mice were implanted with Cre-targeted channelrhodopsin (ChR2) virus and optic fibers in NAc. Subsequently, mice could earn brief NAc laser illuminations by actively touching a metal spout in one task, or by going to a particular location in a separate task. Results indicated that D1 neuronal excitation in NAc supported intense self-stimulation in both tasks. D1-Cre mice earned hundreds to thousands of spout-touches per half-hour session, and also sought out locations that delivered NAc laser to excite D1 MSNs. By comparison, D2 ChR2 mice showed lower but still positive levels of self-stimulation in the spout-touch task, earning dozens to hundreds of NAc laser illuminations. However, in the location task, D2 mice failed to show positive self-stimulation. If anything, a few D2 individuals gradually avoided the laser location. Brain-wide measures indicated that D1 and D2 stimulations in NAc recruited heavily overlapping patterns of Fos activation in distant limbic structures. These results confirm that excitation of D1 MSNs in NAc supports strong incentive motivation to self-stimulate. They also suggest that excitation of D2 neurons in NAc supports self-stimulation under some conditions, but fails under others and possibly may even shift to negative avoidance.},

In this paper, we apply this approach to in vivo recordings of the two major projection cell types in the striatum: the direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons. We expressed ChR2 in the neurons of the direct or indirect pathways using a cre-dependent viral strategy and performed electrical recordings together with optical stimulation using an implanted microwire array that included an integrated optical fiber. Despite the apparent simplicity of identifying ChR2-expressing neurons as those that respond to light, we encountered multiple potential confounds when applying this approach.

	abstract = {The organization of action into sequences underlies complex behaviors that are essential for organismal survival and reproduction. Despite extensive studies of innate sequences in relation to central pattern generators, how learned action sequences are controlled and whether they are organized as a chain or a hierarchy remain largely unknown. By training mice to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we demonstrate that striatal direct and indirect pathways preferentially encode different behavioral levels of sequence structure. State-dependent closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of the striatal direct pathway can selectively insert a single action element into the sequence without disrupting the overall sequence length. Optogenetic manipulation of the striatal indirect pathway completely removes the ongoing subsequence while leaving the following subsequence to be executed with the appropriate timing and length. These results suggest that learned action sequences are not organized in a serial but rather a hierarchical structure that is distinctly controlled by basal ganglia pathways.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) are a group of subcortical nuclei responsible for motor control, motor learning and executive function. Central to BG function are striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. D1 and D2 MSNs are typically considered functional antagonists that facilitate voluntary movements and inhibit competing motor patterns, respectively. While their opposite role is well documented for certain sensorimotor loops of the BG-thalamocortical network, it is unclear whether MSNs maintain a uniform functional role across the striatum and which influence they exert on brain areas outside the BG. Here, we addressed these questions by combining optogenetic activation of D1 and D2 MSNs in the mouse ventrolateral caudoputamen (vl CPu) with whole-brain functional MRI (fMRI) recordings. Neuronal excitation of either cell population in the vl CPu evoked distinct activity patterns in key regions of the BG-thalamocortical network including the pallidum, thalamus and motor cortex. Importantly, we report that striatal D1 and D2 MSN stimulation differentially engaged cerebellar and prefrontal regions. We characterised these long-range interactions by computational modelling of effective connectivity and confirmed that changes in D1 / D2 output drive functional relationships between regions within and beyond the BG. These results suggest a more complex functional organization of MSNs across the striatum than previously anticipated and provide evidence for the existence of an interconnected fronto - BG cerebellar network modulated by striatal D1 and D2 MSNs.},

We examined the roles of direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathway spiny projection neurons in a decision-making task with a short-term memory (STM) component. Optogenetic stimulation of cortical-input-defined dSPNs and iSPNs during STM oppositely biased upcoming licking choice, without affecting licking execution. Optogenetically identified dSPNs and iSPNs showed similar response patterns, although with quantitative difference in spatiotemporal organization. To understand how coactive dSPNs and iSPNs play opposing roles, we recorded population activity in frontal cortex and the basal ganglia output nucleus SNr. Stimulation of dSPNs and iSPNs bidirectionally regulated cortical decision variable through the differential modulation of SNr ramping activity. These results reconcile different views by demonstrating that coactive dSPNs and iSPNs precisely shape cortical activity in a push-pull balance.},

	abstract = {A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, remains unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on the cognitive requirements of a task. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that—even within a single task—the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the demands imposed by a task, as well as the internal state of mice when performing a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.},

We performed a systematic comparison of neural activity in primary visual (V1) to secondary visual and retrosplenial cortices, as mice performed a task where they should accumulate pulsatile visual cues through time to inform a navigational decision. Even in V1, only a small fraction of neurons had sensory-like responses to cues. Instead, in all areas neurons were sequentially active, and contained information ranging from sensory to cognitive, including cue timings, evidence, place/time, decision and reward outcome. Per-cue sensory responses were amplitude-modulated by various cognitive quantities, notably accumulated evidence. This inspired a multiplicative feedback-loop circuit hypothesis that proposes a more intricate role of sensory areas in the accumulation process, and furthermore explains a surprising observation that perceptual discrimination deviates from Weber-Fechner Law.},

How does this organization support hierarchical cognitive control and the rapid discovery of abstract action rules? We present computational models at different levels of description. A neural circuit model simulates interacting corticostriatal circuits organized hierarchically. In each circuit, the basal ganglia gate frontal actions, with some striatal units gating the inputs to PFC and others gating the outputs to influence response selection. Learning at all of these levels is accomplished via dopaminergic reward prediction error signals in each corticostriatal circuit. This functionality allows the system to exhibit conditional if–then hypothesis testing and to learn rapidly in environments with hierarchical structure. We also develop a hybrid Bayesian-reinforcement learning mixture of experts (MoE) model, which can estimate the most likely hypothesis state of individual participants based on their observed sequence of choices and rewards. This model yields accurate probabilistic estimates about which hypotheses are attended by manipulating attentional states in the generative neural model and recovering them with the MoE model. This 2-pronged modeling approach leads to multiple quantitative predictions that are tested with functional magnetic resonance imaging in the companion paper.},

We present several applications of the encoding model framework to the problem of decoding stimulus information from population spike responses: (1) a tractable algorithm for computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the stimulus, the most probable stimulus to have generated an observed single- or multiple-neuron spike train response, given some prior distribution over the stimulus; (2) a gaussian approximation to the posterior stimulus distribution that can be used to quantify the fidelity with which various stimulus features are encoded; (3) an efficient method for estimating the mutual information between the stimulus and the spike trains emitted by a neural population; and (4) a framework for the detection of change-point times (the time at which the stimulus undergoes a change in mean or variance) by marginalizing over the posterior stimulus distribution.

Although many computational models of working memory have been developed, the mechanistic basis of executive function remains elusive, often amounting to a homunculus. This article presents an attempt to deconstruct this homunculus through powerful learning mechanisms that allow a computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate manner. These learning mechanisms are based on subcortical structures in the midbrain, basal ganglia, and amygdala, which together form an actor-critic architecture. The critic system learns which prefrontal representations are task relevant and trains the actor, which in turn provides a dynamic gating mechanism for controlling working memory updating. Computationally, the learning mechanism is designed to simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit assignment problems. The model's performance compares favorably with standard backpropagation-based temporal learning mechanisms on the challenging 1-2-AX working memory task and other benchmark working memory tasks.},

          Perceptual decision-makers often display a constant rate of errors independent of evidence strength. These “lapses” are treated as a nuisance arising from noise tangential to the decision, e.g. inattention or motor errors. Here, we use a multisensory decision task in rats to demonstrate that these explanations cannot account for lapses’ stimulus dependence. We propose a novel explanation: lapses reflect a strategic trade-off between exploiting known rewarding actions and exploring uncertain ones. We tested the model’s predictions by selectively manipulating one action’s reward magnitude or probability. As uniquely predicted by this model, changes were restricted to lapses associated with that action. Finally, we show that lapses are a powerful tool for assigning decision-related computations to neural structures based on disruption experiments (here, posterior striatum and secondary motor cortex). These results suggest that lapses reflect an integral component of decision-making and are informative about action values in normal and disrupted brain states.},

Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track.

These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes.

	abstract = {1. The present paper reports complex neural activities in the monkey caudate nucleus that precede and anticipate visual stimuli and reward in learned visuomotor paradigms. These activities were revealed typically in the delayed saccade task in which memory and anticipation were required. We classified these activities according to their relationships to the task. 2. Activity related to expectation of a cue (n = 46) preceded the presentation of a spot of light (target cue) that signified the future location of saccade target. When the target cue was delayed, the activity was prolonged accordingly. The same spot of light was preceded by no activity if it acted as a distracting stimulus. 3. The sustained activity (n = 80) was a tonic discharge starting after the target cue as if holding the spatial information. 4. The activity related to expectation of target (n = 109) preceded the appearance of the target whose location was cued previously. It started with or after a saccade to the cued target location and ended with the appearance of the target. The activity was greater when the target was expected to appear in the contralateral visual field. 5. The activity related to expectation of reward (n = 57) preceded a task-specific reward. It started with the appearance of the final target and ended with the reward. In most cases, the activity was nonselective for how the monkey obtained the reward, i.e., by visual fixation only, by a saccade, or by a hand movement. The activity was dependent partly on visual fixation. 6. A few neurons showed tonic activity selectively before lever release and are thus considered to be related to the preparation of hand movements. 7. The activity related to breaking fixation (n = 33) occurred phasically if the monkey broke fixation, aborting the trial. 8. Activity related to reward (n = 104) was a phasic discharge that occurred before or after a reward of water was delivered. The activity was not simply related to a specific movement involved in the reward-obtaining behavior (eye, hand, or mouth movement). 9. Fixation-related activity (n = 72) was tonic activity continuing as long as the monkey attentively fixated a spot of light. It was dependent on reward expectancy in most cases. 10. The present results, together with those in the preceding papers, indicate that the activities of individual caudate neurons--sensory, motor, or cognitive--are dependent on specific contexts of learned behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Independent evidence from each of these fields has reinforced a growing perception that the functional architecture of the basal ganglia is essentially parallel in nature, regardless of the perspective from which these structures are viewed. This represents a significant departure from earlier concepts of basal ganglia organization, which generally emphasized the serial aspects of their connectivity. Current evidence suggests that the basal ganglia are organized into several structurally and functionally distinct ‘circuits’ that link cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, with each circuit focused on a different portion of the frontal lobe. In this review, Garrett Alexander and Michael Crutcher, using the basal ganglia ‘motor’ circuit as the principal example, discuss recent evidence indicating that a parallel functional architecture may also be characteristic of the organization within each individual circuit.},

Using a sensitive perceptual decision task in monkeys, we examined the effects of rapid, reversible inactivation on a spatial scale previously achieved only with electrical microstimulation. Inactivating groups of similarly tuned neurons in area MT produced systematic effects on choice and confidence. Behavioral effects were attenuated over the course of each session, suggesting compensatory adjustments in the downstream readout of MT over tens of minutes. Compensation also occurred on a sub-second time scale: behavior was largely unaffected when the visual stimulus (and concurrent suppression) lasted longer than 350 ms. These trends were similar for choice and confidence, consistent with the idea of a common mechanism underlying both measures. The findings demonstrate the utility of hyperpolarizing opsins for linking neural population activity at fine spatial and temporal scales to cognitive functions in primates.},

We apply PsyTrack to training data from mice, rats, and human subjects learning to perform auditory and visual decision-making tasks. We show that it successfully captures trial-to-trial fluctuations in the weighting of sensory stimuli, bias, and task-irrelevant covariates such as choice and stimulus history. This analysis reveals dramatic differences in learning across mice and rapid adaptation to changes in task statistics.

	abstract = {Innate vocal sounds such as laughing, screaming or crying convey one’s feelings to others. In many species, including humans, scaling the amplitude and duration of vocalizations is essential for effective social communication1–3. In mice, female scent triggers male mice to emit innate courtship ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)4,5. However, whether mice flexibly scale their vocalizations and how neural circuits are structured to generate flexibility remain largely unknown. Here we identify mouse neurons from the lateral preoptic area (LPOA) that express oestrogen receptor 1 (LPOAESR1 neurons) and, when activated, elicit the complete repertoire of USV syllables emitted during natural courtship. Neural anatomy and functional data reveal a two-step, di-synaptic circuit motif in which primary long-range inhibitory LPOAESR1 neurons relieve a clamp of local periaqueductal grey (PAG) inhibition, enabling excitatory PAG USV-gating neurons to trigger vocalizations. We find that social context shapes a wide range of USV amplitudes and bout durations. This variability is absent when PAG neurons are stimulated directly; PAG-evoked vocalizations are time-locked to neural activity and stereotypically loud. By contrast, increasing the activity of LPOAESR1 neurons scales the amplitude of vocalizations, and delaying the recovery of the inhibition clamp prolongs USV bouts. Thus, the LPOA disinhibition motif contributes to flexible loudness and the duration and persistence of bouts, which are key aspects of effective vocal social communication.},

While neurons can be optically hyperpolarized and inhibited from firing action potentials at moderate NpHR expression levels, we have encountered challenges with pushing expression to extremely high levels, including apparent intracellular accumulations. We therefore sought to molecularly engineer NpHR to achieve strong expression without these cellular side effects. We found that high expression correlated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) accumulation, and that under these conditions NpHR colocalized with ER proteins containing the KDEL ER retention sequence. We screened a number of different putative modulators of membrane trafficking and identified a combination of two motifs, an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal ER export sequence, that markedly promoted membrane localization and ER export defined by confocal microscopy and whole-cell patch clamp. The modified NpHR displayed increased peak photocurrent in the absence of aggregations or toxicity, and potent optical inhibition was observed not only in vitro but also in vivo with thalamic single-unit recording. The new enhanced NpHR (eNpHR) allows safe, high-level expression in mammalian neurons, without toxicity and with augmented inhibitory function, in vitro and in vivo.},

We implemented a VR setup for rats, including software and large-scale electrophysiology, that supports 2D navigation by allowing rotation and walking in any direction. The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, including place, head direction, and grid cells, showed 2D activity patterns similar to those in the real world. Furthermore, border cells were observed, and hippocampal remapping was driven by environment shape, suggesting functional processing of virtual boundaries. These results illustrate that 2D spatial representations can be engaged by visual and rotational vestibular stimuli alone and suggest a novel VR tool for studying rat navigation.},

Because the reward resulting from a given action can be substantially delayed, the process of linking a reward to its causative action would be facilitated by memory signals related to the animal's previous actions. Although the ventral striatum has been proposed to play a key role in updating the information about the rewards expected from specific actions, it is not known whether the signals related to previous actions exist in the ventral striatum. In the present study, we recorded neuronal ensemble activity in the rat ventral striatum during a visual discrimination task and investigated whether neuronal activity in the ventral striatum encoded signals related to animal's previous actions. The results show that many neurons modulated their activity according to the animal's goal choice in the previous trial, indicating that memory signals for previous actions are available in the ventral striatum. In contrast, few neurons conveyed signals on impending goal choice of the animal, suggesting the absence of decision signals in the ventral striatum.

Ex vivo recordings from medium spiny striatal neurons in brain slices of trained mice revealed that the changes observed in vivo corresponded to regional- and training-specific changes in excitatory synaptic transmission in the striatum. Furthermore, the potentiation of glutamatergic transmission observed in dorsolateral striatum after extensive training was preferentially expressed in striatopallidal neurons, rather than striatonigral neurons.

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are deeply implicated in working memory. Both structures are subject to dopaminergic neuromodulation in a way that exerts a critical influence on the proper operation of working memory. We present a novel network model to elucidate the role of phasic dopamine in the interaction of these two structures in initiating and maintaining mnemonic activity. We argue that neuromodulation plays a critical role in protecting memories against both internal and external sources of noise. Increases in cortical gain engendered by prefrontal dopamine release help make memories robust against external distraction, but do not offer protection against internal noise accompanying recurrent cortical activity. Rather, the output of the basal ganglia provides the gating function of stabilization against noise and distraction by enhancing select memories through targeted disinhibition of cortex. Dopamine in the basal ganglia effectively locks this gate by influencing the stability of up and down states in the striatum. Dopamine’s involvement in affective processing endows this gating with specificity to motivational salience. We model a spatial working memory task and show that these combined effects of dopamine lead to superior performance.},

Neurons in nearly all regions responded non-specifically when the mouse initiated an action. By contrast, neurons encoding visual stimuli and upcoming choices occupied restricted regions in the neocortex, basal ganglia and midbrain. Choice signals were rare and emerged with indistinguishable timing across regions. Midbrain neurons were activated before contralateral choices and were suppressed before ipsilateral choices, whereas forebrain neurons could prefer either side. Brain-wide pre-stimulus activity predicted engagement in individual trials and in the overall task, with enhanced subcortical but suppressed neocortical activity during engagement.

However, the encoding of value-related information in dMSNs and iMSNs during adaptive decision-making is not well understood. We trained mice on a dynamic foraging task where they had to learn the value of different options based on their recent history of choices and outcomes. Single-cell calcium imaging in dorsomedial striatum revealed that dMSNs and iMSNs were oppositely modulated by the updated value of the different options. Additionally, we found that iMSNs were more active as animals slowed between trials, likely reflecting ongoing changes in motivational state. Together, our results demonstrate that co-activation of dMSNs and iMSNs during action initiation does not simply encode action identity, but instead reflects pathway-specific encoding of movement, motivation, and value information necessary for adaptive decision-making.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Analysis of the distinct contributions of each pathway to behavior has been a challenge, however, due to the difficulty of selectively investigating the neurons comprising the two pathways using conventional techniques. Here we present two mouse models in which the function of striatonigral or striatopallidal neurons is selectively disrupted due to cell type–specific deletion of the striatal signaling protein dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32kDa (DARPP-32). Using these mice, we found that the loss of DARPP-32 in striatonigral neurons decreased basal and cocaine-induced locomotion and abolished dyskinetic behaviors in response to the Parkinson's disease drug L-DOPA. Conversely, the loss of DARPP-32 in striatopallidal neurons produced a robust increase in locomotor activity and a strongly reduced cataleptic response to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol. These findings provide insight into the selective contributions of the direct and indirect pathways to striatal motor behaviors.},

To explore how the basal ganglia information is processed and integrated through these two pathways, we developed a reversible neurotransmission blocking technique, in which transmission of each pathway was selectively blocked by specific expression of transmission-blocking tetanus toxin in a doxycycline-dependent manner. The results indicated that the coordinated modulation of these two pathways was necessary for dopamine-mediated acute psychostimulant actions. This modulation, however, shifted to the predominant roles of the direct pathway in reward learning and cocaine sensitization and the indirect pathway in aversive behavior. These two pathways thus have distinct roles: the direct pathway critical for distinguishing associative rewarding stimuli from nonassociative ones and the indirect pathway for rapid memory formation to avoid aversive stimuli.},

Here I show that, despite similar mean firing rate patterns, prefrontal and striatal responses differ in other temporal dynamics for both perceptual and reward-based tasks. Compared with simulation results, the temporal dynamics of prefrontal activity are consistent with an accumulation of sensory evidence used to solve a perceptual task but not with an accumulation of reward context-related information used for the development of a reward bias. In contrast, the dynamics of striatal activity is consistent with an accumulation of reward context-related information and with an accumulation of sensory evidence during early stimulus viewing. These results suggest that prefrontal and striatal neurons may have specialized functions for different tasks even with similar average activity.},

The dorsal striatum, which can be further subdivided into dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum, is mainly composed of two subpopulations of striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs): dopamine D1 receptor-expressing MSNs that constitute the striatonigral or direct pathway (dMSNs); and dopamine D2 receptor-expressing MSNs that constitute the striatopallidal or indirect pathway (iMSNs) [3]. It has been suggested that each pathway has opposing roles in reinforcement, with dMSNs being important to learn positive reinforcement and iMSNs to learn to avoid undesired actions (Go/No-Go) [1]. Furthermore, optogenetic self-stimulation of dMSNs in DMS leads to reinforcement of actions, while self-stimulation of iMSNs leads to avoidance of actions [2]. However, in DLS, which has been implicated in the consolidation of well-trained actions and habits in mice 4, 5, both pathways are active during lever-pressing for reward [6]. Furthermore, extensive skill training leads to long-lasting potentiation of glutamatergic inputs into both dMSNs and iMSNs [4]. We report here that, in DLS, both dMSNs and iMSNs are involved in positive reinforcement, but support different action strategies.},

D1- and D2-MSNs exhibit different patterns of lick-sequence-related activity and different phases of oscillation time-locked to the lick cycle.

The opposite imbalance might underlie hyperkinetic abnormalities, such as dyskinesia caused by treatment of Parkinson’s disease with the dopamine precursor l-DOPA. Here we monitored thousands of SPNs in behaving mice, before and after dopamine depletion and during l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Normally, intermingled clusters of dSPNs and iSPNs coactivated before movement. Dopamine depletion unbalanced SPN activity rates and disrupted the movement-encoding iSPN clusters. Matching their clinical efficacy, l-DOPA or agonism of the D2 dopamine receptor reversed these abnormalities more effectively than agonism of the D1 dopamine receptor. The opposite pathophysiology arose in l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, during which iSPNs showed hypoactivity and dSPNs showed unclustered hyperactivity. Therefore, both the spatiotemporal profiles and rates of SPN activity appear crucial to striatal function, and next-generation treatments for basal ganglia disorders should target both facets of striatal activity.},

To address these issues, we recorded simultaneously in sensorimotor and associative regions of the striatum as rats learned different versions of a conditional T-maze task. We found highly contrasting patterns of activity in these regions during task performance and found that these different patterns of structured activity developed concurrently, but with sharply different dynamics.

Lick offset-related activity increase is largely dSPN selective, suggesting dSPN involvement in suppressing ongoing licking behavior.

Such transformation is thought to involve cortical circuits capable of computation over time scales associated with working memory, attention, and planning. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are thought to play a role in all of these functions, and much of what is known about the neurobiology of decision making has been influenced by studies of LIP and its network of cortical and subcortical connections. However a causal role of neurons in LIP remains controversial. We used pharmacological and chemogenetic methods to inactivate LIP in one hemisphere of four rhesus monkeys. Inactivation produced clear biases in decisions, but the effects dissipated despite the persistence of neural inactivation, implying compensation by other unaffected areas. Compensation occurs on a rapid times scale, within an experimental session, and more gradually, across sessions.

	abstract = {Advanced imaging methods now allow cell-type-specific recording of neural activity across the mammalian brain, potentially enabling the exploration of how brain-wide dynamical patterns give rise to complex behavioural states1–12. Dissociation is an altered behavioural state in which the integrity of experience is disrupted, resulting in reproducible cognitive phenomena including the dissociation of stimulus detection from stimulus-related affective responses. Dissociation can occur as a result of trauma, epilepsy or dissociative drug use13,14, but despite its substantial basic and clinical importance, the underlying neurophysiology of this state is unknown. Here we establish such a dissociation-like state in mice, induced by precisely-dosed administration of ketamine or phencyclidine. Large-scale imaging of neural activity revealed that these dissociative agents elicited a 1–3-Hz rhythm in layer 5 neurons of the retrosplenial cortex. Electrophysiological recording with four simultaneously deployed high-density probes revealed rhythmic coupling of the retrosplenial cortex with anatomically connected components of thalamus circuitry, but uncoupling from most other brain regions was observed—including a notable inverse correlation with frontally projecting thalamic nuclei. In testing for causal significance, we found that rhythmic optogenetic activation of retrosplenial cortex layer 5 neurons recapitulated dissociation-like behavioural effects. Local retrosplenial hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1 (HCN1) pacemakers were required for systemic ketamine to induce this rhythm and to elicit dissociation-like behavioural effects. In a patient with focal epilepsy, simultaneous intracranial stereoencephalography recordings from across the brain revealed a similarly localized rhythm in the homologous deep posteromedial cortex that was temporally correlated with pre-seizure self-reported dissociation, and local brief electrical stimulation of this region elicited dissociative experiences. These results identify the molecular, cellular and physiological properties of a conserved deep posteromedial cortical rhythm that underlies states of dissociation.},

	abstract = {Decisions take time, and as a rule more difficult decisions take more time. But this only raises the question of what consumes the time. For decisions informed by a sequence of samples of evidence, the answer is straightforward: more samples are available with more time. Indeed, the speed and accuracy of such decisions are explained by the accumulation of evidence to a threshold or bound. However, the same framework seems to apply to decisions that are not obviously informed by sequences of evidence samples. Here, we proffer the hypothesis that the sequential character of such tasks involves retrieval of evidence from memory. We explore this hypothesis by focusing on value-based decisions and argue that mnemonic processes can account for regularities in choice and decision time. We speculate on the neural mechanisms that link sampling of evidence from memory to circuits that represent the accumulated evidence bearing on a choice. We propose that memory processes may contribute to a wider class of decisions that conform to the regularities of choice-reaction time predicted by the sequential sampling framework.},

	abstract = {The indirect pathway striatal medium spiny projection neurons (iMSNs) are critical to motor and cognitive brain functions. These neurons express a high level of cAMP-increasing adenosine A2a receptors. However, the potential effects of cAMP production on iMSN spiking activity have not been established, and recording identified iMSNs in freely moving animals is challenging. Here, we show that in the transgenic mice expressing cAMP-producing G protein Gs-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (Gs-DREADD) in iMSNs, the baseline spike firing in MSNs is normal, indicating DREADD expression does not affect the normal physiology of these neurons. Intraperitoneal injection of the DREADD agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 2.5 mg/kg) increased the spike firing in 50\% of the recorded MSNs. However, CNO did not affect MSN firing in Gs-DREADD-negative mice. We also found that CNO injection inhibited the spike firing of globus pallidus external segment (GPe) neurons in Gs-DREADD-positive mice, further indicating CNO excitation of iMSNs. Temporally coincident with these effects on spiking firing in the indirect pathway, CNO injection selectively inhibited locomotion in D2 Gs-DREADD mice. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that cAMP production in iMSNs can increase iMSN spiking activity and cause motor inhibition, thus addressing a long-standing question about the cellular functions of the cAMP-producing adenosine A2a receptors in iMSNs.

	abstract = {The striatum controls food-related actions and consumption and is linked to feeding disorders, including obesity and anorexia nervosa. Two populations of neurons project from the striatum: direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons. The selective contribution of direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons to food-related actions and consumption remains unknown. Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology and fiber photometry in mice (of both sexes) to record both spiking activity and pathway-specific calcium activity of dorsal striatal neurons during approach to and consumption of food pellets. While electrophysiology revealed complex task-related dynamics across neurons, population calcium was enhanced during approach and inhibited during consumption in both pathways. We also observed ramping changes in activity that preceded both pellet-directed actions and spontaneous movements. These signals were heterogeneous in the spiking units, with neurons exhibiting either increasing or decreasing ramps. In contrast, the population calcium signals were homogeneous, with both pathways having increasing ramps of activity for several seconds before actions were initiated. An analysis comparing population firing rates to population calcium signals also revealed stronger ramping dynamics in the calcium signals than in the spiking data. In a second experiment, we trained the mice to perform an action sequence to evaluate when the ramping signals terminated. We found that the ramping signals terminated at the beginning of the action sequence, suggesting they may reflect upcoming actions and not preconsumption activity. Plasticity of such mechanisms may underlie disorders that alter action selection, such as drug addiction or obesity.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alterations in striatal function have been linked to pathological consumption in disorders, such as obesity and drug addiction. We recorded spiking and population calcium activity from the dorsal striatum during ad libitum feeding and an operant task that resulted in mice obtaining food pellets. Dorsal striatal neurons exhibited long ramps in activity that preceded actions by several seconds, and may reflect upcoming actions. Understanding how the striatum controls the preparation and generation of actions may lead to improved therapies for disorders, such as drug addiction or obesity.},

Contemporary research has focused on the contribution of striatal sub-regions to three main phenomena: learning of associations between stimuli, actions and rewards; selection between competing response alternatives; and motivational modulation of motor behavior. Recent proposals have argued for a functional division of the striatum along these lines, attributing, for example, learning to one region and performance to another. Here, we consider empirical data from human and animal studies, as well as theoretical notions from both the psychological and computational literatures, and conclude that striatal sub-regions instead differ most clearly in terms of the associations being encoded in each region.},

Two basal ganglia pathways have been classically hypothesized to regulate this process via opposing roles in movement facilitation and suppression. By using a series of state-dependent optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the contributions of each pathway and found that both the direct striatonigral pathway and the indirect striatopallidal pathway are necessary for smooth initiation and the execution of learned action sequences. Optogenetic inhibition or stimulation of each pathway before sequence initiation increased the latency for initiation: manipulations of the striatonigral pathway activity slowed action initiation, and those of the striatopallidal pathway aborted action initiation. The inhibition of each pathway after initiation also impaired ongoing execution. Furthermore, the subtle activation of striatonigral neurons sustained the performance of learned sequences, while striatopallidal manipulations aborted ongoing performance. These results suggest a supportive versus permissive model, where patterns of coordinated activity, rather than the relative amount of activity in these pathways, regulate movement initiation and execution.},

First, research to understand the most debilitating aspects of HD have suggested that cognitive and behavioral changes place the greatest burden on families, are most highly associated with functional decline, and can be predictive of institutionalization. Second, cognitive impairments are evident at least 15 years prior to the time at which motor diagnosis is given. Finally, cognitive decline is associated with biological markers such as brain atrophy, circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factors, and insulin-like growth factor I.

We discovered that mice with distinct cognitive experiences, beyond sensory and motor learning, use different cortical areas and neural activity patterns to solve the same task, revealing past learning as a critical determinant of whether cortex is necessary for decision-making. We used optogenetics and calcium imaging to study the necessity and neural activity of multiple cortical areas in mice with different training histories. Posterior parietal cortex and retrosplenial cortex were mostly dispensable for accurate decision-making in mice performing a simple navigation-based decision task. In contrast, these areas were essential for the same simple task when mice were previously trained on complex tasks with delay periods or association switches. Multi-area calcium imaging showed that, in mice with complex-task experience, single-neuron activity had higher selectivity and neuron-neuron correlations were weaker, leading to codes with higher task information. Therefore, past experience sets the landscape for how future tasks are solved by the brain and is a key factor in determining whether cortical areas have a causal role in decision-making.},

Striatum projects to downstream nuclei through direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathway projection neurons thought to exert opposite effects on movement. In rodent models of striatal function, unilateral dopamine deprivation induces ipsiversive rotational behavior. The dSPNs of the dorsal striatum are believed to engage distinct motor programs but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show by employing chemogenetics [Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs)] that unilateral inhibition of dorsomedial dSPNs is sufficient to selectively impair contraversive movement and elicit ipsiversive rotational behavior in mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding Cre-dependent Gi-coupled DREADD was injected unilaterally into the dorsomedial striatum of Drd1-Cre mice, resulting in expression of the modified human M4 muscarinic receptor (hM4Di) in ∼20\% of dorsostriatal dSPNs. Upon hM4Di activation, a striking positive linear correlation was found between turn ratio and viral expression, which corroborates a relationship between unilateral inhibition of dorsomedial dSPNs and rotational behavior. Bursts of ipsiversive rotations were interspersed with normal ambulation. However, partial unilateral inhibition of ∼20\% of dorsostriatal dSPNs did not affect horizontal and vertical locomotion or forelimb use preference. Overall, our results substantiate a unique role of dSPNs in promoting response bias in rotational behavior and show this to be a highly sensitive measure of dSPN performance.},

	abstract = {Perceptual decision making is a complex process that requires multiple computations, including the accumulation of sensory evidence and an ongoing evaluation of the accumulation process to use for prediction and adjustment. Implementing these computations likely involves interactions among many brain regions. For perceptual decisions linked to oculomotor actions, neural correlates of sensory evidence accumulation have been identified in several cortical areas, including the frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal area, and one of their direct, subcortical targets, the superior colliculus. These structures are also connected indirectly, via the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia pathway has been theorized to contribute to perceptual decision making, but the nature of this contribution has yet to be examined directly. Here we show that in monkeys performing a reaction-time visual motion direction-discrimination task, neurons in a primary input structure of the basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus, encode three aspects of decision making: evidence accumulation, evaluation, and choice biases. These results indicate that the basal ganglia pathway can provide important signals to influence and assess perceptual decisions that guide oculomotor behavior.},

	abstract = {The nucleus accumbens is a key mediator of cocaine reward, but the distinct roles of the two subpopulations of nucleus accumbens projection neurons, those expressing dopamine D1 versus D2 receptors, are poorly understood. We show that deletion of TrkB, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, selectively from D1+ or D2+ neurons oppositely affects cocaine reward. Because loss of TrkB in D2+ neurons increases their neuronal excitability, we next used optogenetic tools to control selectively the firing rate of D1+ and D2+ nucleus accumbens neurons and studied consequent effects on cocaine reward. Activation of D2+ neurons, mimicking the loss of TrkB, suppresses cocaine reward, with opposite effects induced by activation of D1+ neurons. These results provide insight into the molecular control of D1+ and D2+ neuronal activity as well as the circuit-level contribution of these cell types to cocaine reward.

	abstract = {Optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity through excitatory and inhibitory opsins has become an indispensable experimental strategy in neuroscience research. For many applications bidirectional control of neuronal activity allowing both excitation and inhibition of the same neurons in a single experiment is desired. This requires low spectral overlap between the excitatory and inhibitory opsin, matched photocurrent amplitudes and a fixed expression ratio. Moreover, independent activation of two distinct neuronal populations with different optogenetic actuators is still challenging due to blue-light sensitivity of all opsins. Here we report BiPOLES, an optogenetic tool for potent neuronal excitation and inhibition with light of two different wavelengths. BiPOLES enables sensitive, reliable dual-color neuronal spiking and silencing with single- or two-photon excitation, optical tuning of the membrane voltage, and independent optogenetic control of two neuronal populations using a second, blue-light sensitive opsin. The utility of BiPOLES is demonstrated in worms, flies, mice and ferrets.},

Recent studies have revealed that the head and tail of the caudate nucleus selectively and differentially process flexible and stable values of visual objects. These signals are sent to the superior colliculus through different parts of the substantia nigra, so that the animal looks preferentially at high-valued objects, but in different manners. Relying on short-term value memories, the caudate head circuit allows gaze to move expectantly to recently valued objects. Relying on long-term value memories, the caudate tail circuit allows gaze to move automatically to previously valued objects. The basal ganglia also contain an equivalent parallel mechanism for action values.

We found that hundreds of units could be recorded for multiple months, but that yields depended systematically on anatomical position. Explanted probes displayed a small increase in noise compared to unimplanted probes, but this was insufficient to impair future single-unit recordings. We conclude that cost-effective, multi-region, and multi-probe Neuropixels recordings can be carried out with high yields over multiple months in rats or other similarly sized animals. Our methods and observations may facilitate the standardization of chronic recording from Neuropixels probes in freely moving animals.},

	abstract = {Action selection during decision-making depends on the basal ganglia circuits that comprise the direct and indirect pathways known to oppositely control movement. However, the mechanism for coordinating these opponent pathways during decision-making remains unclear. We address this by employing deep-brain two-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulations of the direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) in the posterior striatum during an auditory decision-making behavior. We show that while dSPNs and iSPNs play opposite causal roles during decision-making, each subtype contains divergent ensembles preferring different choices. The ensembles in dSPNs show stronger contralateral dominance than those in iSPNs manifested by higher-level activation and synchronization. Consistent with this asymmetrical contralateral dominance, optogenetic disinhibition of both pathways promoted contralateral choices. A computational model incorporating the striatal ensemble asymmetry recapitulated the causal behavioral effects. Our results uncover the asymmetry between opponent SPN ensembles as a circuit mechanism for action selection during decision-making.},

Here, using focal trans-synaptic anterograde tracing, we show that the motor-action-related topographical organization of the striatum is preserved in all BG output nuclei. The topography is also maintained downstream of the BG and in multiple parallel closed loops that provide striatal input. Furthermore, focal activation of two distinct striatal regions induces either licking or turning, consistent with their respective anatomical targets of projection outside of the BG. Our results confirm the parallel model of BG function and suggest that the integration and competition of information relating to different behavior occur largely outside of the BG.},

	isbn = {978-1-5108-3881-9},
	abstract = {Neuroscience experiments often require training animals to perform tasks designed to elicit various sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors. Training typically involves a series of gradual adjustments of stimulus conditions and rewards in order to bring about learning. However, training protocols are usually hand-designed, relying on a combination of intuition, guesswork, and trial-and-error, and often require weeks or months to achieve a desired level of task performance. Here we combine ideas from reinforcement learning and adaptive optimal experimental design to formulate methods for adaptive optimal training of animal behavior. Our work addresses two intriguing problems at once: first, it seeks to infer the learning rules underlying an animal's behavioral changes during training; second, it seeks to exploit these rules to select stimuli that will maximize the rate of learning toward a desired objective. We develop and test these methods using data collected from rats during training on a two-interval sensory discrimination task. We show that we can accurately infer the parameters of a policy-gradient-based learning algorithm that describes how the animal's internal model of the task evolves over the course of training. We then formulate a theory for optimal training, which involves selecting sequences of stimuli that will drive the animal's internal policy toward a desired location in the parameter space. Simulations show that our method can in theory provide a substantial speedup over standard training methods. We feel these results will hold considerable theoretical and practical implications both for researchers in reinforcement learning and for experimentalists seeking to train animals.},

Now a study of rats navigating a maze demonstrates that as animals acquire a habit through training and then lose the habit and again acquire it through further bouts of training, waves of changing activity occur in the basal ganglia.

It receives afferents from limbic structures and from association and motor cortical areas dealing with the cognitive and motivational control of behavior, the preparation of behavioral acts and the control of ongoing movements. Since a major part of basal ganglia output is directed back to the frontal lobe, the functions of the striatum are intimately linked to those of prefrontal, premotor and motor cortex. The striatum is also innervated by midbrain dopamine neurons which are involved in basic behavioral activating processes and goal-directed behavior. The study of behavioral deficits in Parkinsonian patients and experimentally lesioned animals demonstrates that the intact striatal dopamine innervation is important for the expression of striatal behavioral control functions.},

	abstract = {The gradual accumulation of sensory evidence is a crucial component of perceptual decision making, but its neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. Given the wide availability of genetic and optical tools for mice, they can be useful model organisms for the study of these phenomena; however, behavioral tools are largely lacking. Here, we describe a new evidence-accumulation task for head-fixed mice navigating in a virtual reality environment. As they navigate down the stem of a virtual T-maze, they see brief pulses of visual evidence on either side, and retrieve a reward on the arm with the highest number of pulses. The pulses occur randomly with Poisson statistics, yielding a diverse yet well-controlled stimulus set, making the data conducive to a variety of computational approaches. A large number of mice of different genotypes were able to learn and consistently perform the task, at levels similar to rats in analogous tasks. They are sensitive to side differences of a single pulse, and their memory of the cues is stable over time. Moreover, using non-parametric as well as modeling approaches, we show that the mice indeed accumulate evidence: they use multiple pulses of evidence from throughout the cue region of the maze to make their decision, albeit with a small overweighting of earlier cues, and their performance is affected by the magnitude but not the duration of evidence. Additionally, analysis of the mice's running patterns revealed that trajectories are fairly stereotyped yet modulated by the amount of sensory evidence, suggesting that the navigational component of this task may provide a continuous readout correlated to the underlying cognitive variables. Our task, which can be readily integrated with state-of-the-art techniques, is thus a valuable tool to study the circuit mechanisms and dynamics underlying perceptual decision making, particularly under more complex behavioral contexts.},

Studies of perceptual decision-making have often assumed that sensory cortices provide noisy but otherwise veridical sensory inputs to downstream processes that accumulate and drive decisions. However, sensory processing in even the earliest sensory cortices can be systematically modified by various external and internal contexts. We recorded from neuronal populations across posterior cortex as mice performed a navigational decision-making task based on accumulating randomly timed pulses of visual evidence. Even in V1, only a small fraction of active neurons had sensory-like responses time-locked to each pulse. Here, we focus on how these ‘cue-locked’ neurons exhibited a variety of amplitude modulations from sensory to cognitive, notably by choice and accumulated evidence. These task-related modulations affected a large fraction of cue-locked neurons across posterior cortex, suggesting that future models of behavior should account for such influences.},

Importantly, positive and negative signals within the striatum, thalamus, GPi, and STN were all associated with increases and decreases in single-unit activity, respectively.

Linear electrode arrays, such as Neuropixels probes, have hundreds of recording electrodes distributed over linear shanks that span several millimeters. Because of the length of the probes, linear probe recordings in rodents usually cover multiple brain areas. Typical studies collate recordings across several recording sessions and animals. Neurons recorded in different sessions and animals thus have to be aligned to each other and to a standardized brain coordinate system. Here, we evaluate two typical workflows for localization of individual electrodes in standardized coordinates. These workflows rely on imaging brains with fluorescent probe tracks and warping 3D image stacks to standardized brain atlases. One workflow is based on tissue clearing and selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), whereas the other workflow is based on serial block-face two-photon (SBF2P) microscopy. In both cases electrophysiological features are then used to anchor particular electrodes along the reconstructed tracks to specific locations in the brain atlas and therefore to specific brain structures. We performed groundtruth experiments, in which motor cortex outputs are labeled with ChR2 and a fluorescence protein. Light-evoked electrical activity and fluorescence can be independently localized. Recordings from brain regions targeted by the motor cortex reveal better than 0.1-mm accuracy for electrode localization, independent of workflow used.},

	abstract = {An open question in systems and computational neuroscience is how neural circuits accumulate evidence towards a decision. Fitting models of decision-making theory to neural activity helps answer this question, but current approaches limit the number of these models that we can fit to neural data. Here we propose a general framework for modeling neural activity during decision-making. The framework includes the canonical drift-diffusion model and enables extensions such as multi-dimensional accumulators, variable and collapsing boundaries, and discrete jumps. Our framework is based on constraining the parameters of recurrent state space models, for which we introduce a scalable variational Laplace EM inference algorithm. We applied the modeling approach to spiking responses recorded from monkey parietal cortex during two decision-making tasks. We found that a two-dimensional accumulator better captured the responses of a set of parietal neurons than a single accumulator model, and we identified a variable lower boundary in the responses of a parietal neuron during a random dot motion task. We expect this framework will be useful for modeling neural dynamics in a variety of decision-making settings.},

	abstract = {Many modern time-series datasets contain large numbers of output response variables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience, the activities of 100s-1000's of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in response to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the nonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple outputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations between the output response variables are invariant in the input space. Stochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend on input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output dependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for large datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series problems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal stochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint amongst the mixing coefficients. This constraint reduces the computational burden of inference while retaining the capability to handle complex output dependence. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedures for both SLMM and OSLMM and demonstrate superior model scalability and reduced prediction error of OSLMM compared with state-of-the-art methods on several real-world applications. In neurophysiology recordings, we use the inferred latent functions for compact visualization of population responses to auditory stimuli, and demonstrate superior results compared to a competing method (GPFA). Together, these results demonstrate that OSLMM will be useful for the analysis of diverse, large-scale time-series datasets.},

Perception cycles through periods of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to external information. Here, we asked whether such infra-slow oscillations arise as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited processing capacity or, alternatively, represent a structured mechanism of perceptual inference. Using two large-scale datasets, we found that humans and mice waver between alternating intervals of externally- and internally-oriented modes of sensory analysis. During external mode, perception was more sensitive to external sensory information, whereas internal mode was characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history. Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are governed by two interlinked factors: (i), the integration of subsequent stimuli over time and, (ii), infra-slow anti-phase oscillations in the perceptual impact of external sensory information versus internal predictions that are provided by perceptual history. Between-mode fluctuations may benefit perception by enabling the generation of stable representations of the environment despite an ongoing stream of noisy sensory inputs.},

These ‘lapses’ are treated as a nuisance arising from noise tangential to the decision, e.g. inattention or motor errors. Here, we use a multisensory decision task in rats to demonstrate that these explanations cannot account for lapses’ stimulus dependence. We propose a novel explanation: lapses reflect a strategic trade-off between exploiting known rewarding actions and exploring uncertain ones. We tested this model’s predictions by selectively manipulating one action’s reward magnitude or probability. As uniquely predicted by this model, changes were restricted to lapses associated with that action. Finally, we show that lapses are a powerful tool for assigning decision-related computations to neural structures based on disruption experiments (here, posterior striatum and secondary motor cortex). These results suggest that lapses reflect an integral component of decision-making and are informative about action values in normal and disrupted brain states.},

Whereas past work has modeled the selection of the higher rewarding port in such tasks, we sought to also model the trial-to-trial changes in port selection − i.e. the action switching behavior. We find that mouse behavior deviates from the theoretically optimal agent performing Bayesian inference in a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead the strategy of mice can be well-described by a set of models that we demonstrate are mathematically equivalent: a logistic regression, drift diffusion model, and ′sticky′ Bayesian model. Here we show that switching behavior of mice is characterized by several components that are conserved across models, namely a stochastic action policy, a representation of action value, and a tendency to repeat actions despite incoming evidence. When fit to mouse behavior, the expected reward under these models lies near a plateau of the value landscape even in changing reward probability contexts. These results indicate that mouse behavior reaches near-maximal performance with reduced action switching and can be described by models with a small number of relatively fixed-parameters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To overcome these drawbacks, we propose to use a more suitable model initialization approach, a Segmentation-Clustering and Transient analysis (SCT) framework, to estimate the number of states and model parameters directly from the input data. Based on an analysis of the information flow through HMMs, we demystify the structure of models and show that high-impact states are directly identifiable from the properties of observation sequences. States having a high impact on the log-likelihood make HMMs highly specific. Experimental results show that even though the identification accuracy drops to 87.9\% when random models are considered, the SCT method is around 50 to 260 times faster than the BW algorithm with 100\% correct identification for highly specific models whose specificity is greater than 0.06.},

We use this approach to obtain estimates of parameters for a dynamical model of neural population data, where the observed spike-counts are Poisson-distributed with log-rates determined by the latent dynamical process, possibly driven by external inputs. We show that the extended subspace identiﬁcation algorithm is consistent and accurately recovers the correct parameters on large simulated data sets with a single calculation, avoiding the costly iterative computation of approximate expectation-maximisation (EM). Even on smaller data sets, it provides an effective initialisation for EM, avoiding local optima and speeding convergence. These beneﬁts are shown to extend to real neural data.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          How do we know our social rank? Most social species, from insects to humans, self-organize into social dominance hierarchies (1–4). The establishment of social ranks serves to decrease aggression, conserve energy, and maximize survival for the entire group (5–8). Despite dominance behaviors being critical for successful interactions and ultimately, survival, we have only begun to learn how the brain represents social rank (9–12) and guides behavior based on this representation. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the expression of social dominance in rodents (10,11), and in social rank learning in humans (13,14). Yet precisely how the mPFC encodes rank and which circuits mediate this computation is not known. We developed a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete for rewards, as well as a computer vision tool to track multiple, unmarked animals. With the development of a deep learning computer vision tool (AlphaTracker) and wireless electrophysiology recording devices, we have established a novel platform to facilitate quantitative examination of how the brain gives rise to social behaviors. We describe nine behavioral states during social competition that were accurately decoded from mPFC ensemble activity using a hidden Markov model combined with generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). Population dynamics in the mPFC were predictive of social rank and competitive success. This population-level rank representation translated into differences in the individual cell responses to task-relevant events across ranks. Finally, we demonstrate that mPFC cells that project to the lateral hypothalamus contribute to the prediction of social rank and promote dominance behavior during the reward competition. Thus, we reveal a cortico-hypothalamic circuit by which mPFC exerts top-down modulation of social dominance.},

	abstract = {Spectral learning recently generated lots of excitement in machine learning, largely because it is the first known method to produce consistent estimates (under suitable conditions) for several latent variable models. In contrast, maximum likelihood estimates may get trapped in local optima due to the non-convex nature of the likelihood function of latent variable models. In this paper, we do an empirical evaluation of spectral learning (SL) and expectation maximization (EM), which reveals an important gap between the theory and the practice. First, SL often leads to negative probabilities. Second, EM often yields better estimates than spectral learning and it does not seem to get stuck in local optima. We discuss how the rank of the model parameters and the amount of training data can yield negative probabilities. We also question the common belief that maximum likelihood estimators are necessarily inconsistent.},

	abstract = {Behavior arises from the coordinated activity of numerous anatomically and functionally distinct brain regions. Modern experimental tools allow unprecedented access to large neural populations spanning many interacting regions brain-wide. Yet, understanding such large-scale datasets necessitates both scalable computational models to extract meaningful features of interregion communication and principled theories to interpret those features. Here, we introduce Current-Based Decomposition (CURBD), an approach for inferring brain-wide interactions using data-constrained recurrent neural network models that directly reproduce experimentally-obtained neural data. CURBD leverages the functional interactions inferred by such models to reveal directional currents between multiple brain regions. We first show that CURBD accurately isolates inter-region currents in simulated networks with known dynamics. We then apply CURBD to multi-region neural recordings obtained from mice during running, macaques during Pavlovian conditioning, and humans during memory retrieval to demonstrate the widespread applicability of CURBD to untangle brain-wide interactions underlying behavior from a variety of neural datasets.},

In this paper we relax their assumptions and prove a tighter ﬁnite-sample error bound for the case of Reduced-Rank HMMs, i.e., HMMs with low-rank transition matrices. Since rank-k RR-HMMs are a larger class of models than k-state HMMs while being equally eﬃcient to work with, this relaxation greatly increases the learning algorithm’s scope. In addition, we generalize the algorithm and bounds to models where multiple observations are needed to disambiguate state, and to models that emit multivariate real-valued observations. Finally we prove consistency for learning Predictive State Representations, an even larger class of models. Experiments on synthetic data and a toy video, as well as on diﬃcult robot vision data, yield accurate models that compare favorably with alternatives in simulation quality and prediction accuracy.},

The process of deliberation can be described by a time-varying decision variable (DV), decoded from neural population activity, that predicts a subject’s upcoming decision2. Within single trials, however, there are large moment-to-moment fluctuations in the DV, the behavioural significance of which is unclear. Here, using real-time, neural feedback control of stimulus duration, we show that within-trial DV fluctuations, decoded from motor cortex, are tightly linked to decision state in macaques, predicting behavioural choices substantially better than the condition-averaged DV or the visual stimulus alone. Furthermore, robust changes in DV sign have the statistical regularities expected from behavioural studies of changes of mind3. Probing the decision process on single trials with weak stimulus pulses, we find evidence for time-varying absorbing decision bounds, enabling us to distinguish between specific models of decision making.},

	abstract = {Generalized linear models (GLMs)—such as logistic regression, Poisson regression, and robust regression—provide interpretable models for diverse data types. Probabilistic approaches, particularly Bayesian ones, allow coherent estimates of uncertainty, incorporation of prior information, and sharing of power across experiments via hierarchical models. In practice, however, the approximate Bayesian methods necessary for inference have either failed to scale to large data sets or failed to provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of inference. We propose a new approach based on constructing polynomial approximate sufﬁcient statistics for GLMs (PASS-GLM). We demonstrate that our method admits a simple algorithm as well as trivial streaming and distributed extensions that do not compound error across computations. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of point (MAP) estimates, the approximate posterior, and posterior mean and uncertainty estimates. We validate our approach empirically in the case of logistic regression using a quadratic approximation and show competitive performance with stochastic gradient descent, MCMC, and the Laplace approximation in terms of speed and multiple measures of accuracy—including on an advertising data set with 40 million data points and 20,000 covariates.},

	abstract = {Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) has been broadly applied to the problem of identifying smooth, low-dimensional temporal structure underlying large-scale neural recordings. However, spike trains are non-Gaussian, which motivates combining GPFA with discrete observation models for binned spike count data. The drawback to this approach is that GPFA priors are not conjugate to count model likelihoods, which makes inference challenging. Here we address this obstacle by introducing a fast, approximate inference method for non-conjugate GPFA models. Our approach uses orthogonal second-order polynomials to approximate the nonlinear terms in the non-conjugate log-likelihood, resulting in a method we refer to as {\textbackslash}textit\{polynomial approximate log-likelihood\} (PAL) estimators. This approximation allows for accurate closed-form evaluation of marginal likelihoods and fast numerical optimization for parameters and hyperparameters. We derive PAL estimators for GPFA models with binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial observations and find the PAL estimation is highly accurate, and achieves faster convergence times compared to existing state-of-the-art inference methods. We also find that PAL hyperparameters can provide sensible initialization for black box variational inference (BBVI), which improves BBVI accuracy. We demonstrate that PAL estimators achieve fast and accurate extraction of latent structure from multi-neuron spike train data.},

In general, learning HMMs from data is computationally hard (under cryptographic assumptions), and practitioners typically resort to search heuristics which suffer from the usual local optima issues. We prove that under a natural separation condition (bounds on the smallest singular value of the HMM parameters), there is an efficient and provably correct algorithm for learning HMMs. The sample complexity of the algorithm does not explicitly depend on the number of distinct (discrete) observations---it implicitly depends on this quantity through spectral properties of the underlying HMM. This makes the algorithm particularly applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in natural language processing where the space of observation is sometimes the words in a language. The algorithm is also simple, employing only a singular value decomposition and matrix multiplications.},

	abstract = {Drug addiction can be conceptualized as a disturbance of behavior motivated by drug-conditioned incentives. This abnormality has been explained by Incentive-Sensitization and Allostatic-Counteradaptive theories as the result of non-associative mechanisms acting at the stage of the expression of incentive motivation and responding for drug reinforcement. Each one of these theories, however, does not account per se for two basic properties of the motivational disturbance of drug addiction: (1) focussing on drug- at the expenses of non-drug-incentives; (2) virtual irreversibility. To account for the above aspects we have proposed an associative learning hypothesis. According to this hypothesis the basic disturbance of drug addiction takes place at the stage of acquisition of motivation and in particular of Pavlovian incentive learning. Drugs share with non-drug rewards the property of stimulating dopamine (DA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell but this effect does not undergo habituation upon repeated drug exposure, as instead is the case of non-drug rewards. Repetitive, non-decremental stimulation of DA transmission by drugs in the nucleus accumbens septi (NAc) shell abnormally strenghtens stimulus–drug associations. Thus, stimuli contingent upon drug reward acquire powerful incentive properties after a relatively limited number of predictive associations with the drug and become particularly resistant to extinction. Non-contingent occurrence of drug-conditioned incentive cues or contexts strongly facilitates and eventually reinstates drug self-administration. Repeated drug exposure also induces a process of sensitization of drug-induced stimulation of DA transmission in the NAc core. The precise significance of this adaptive change for the mechanism of drug addiction is unclear given the complexity and uncertainties surrounding the role of NAc core DA in responding but might be more directly related to instrumental performance.},

As the mesolimbic dopamine system undergoes dynamic changes during adolescence in the rat, it is possible that dopamine transients encode reward and stimulus presentations differently in adolescents. However, to date no measurements of dopamine transients in awake adolescents have been made. Thus, we used fast scan cyclic voltammetry to measure dopamine transients in the nucleus accumbens core of male rats (29–30 days of age) at baseline and with the presentation of various stimuli that have been shown to trigger dopamine release in adult rats. We found that dopamine transients were detectable in adolescent rats and occurred at a baseline rate similar to adult rats (71–72 days of age). However, unlike adults, adolescent rats did not reliably exhibit dopamine transients at the unexpected presentation of visual, audible and odorous stimuli. In contrast, brief interaction with another rat increased dopamine transients in both adolescent and adult rats. While this effect habituated in adults at a second interaction, it persisted in the adolescents. These data are the first demonstration of dopamine transients in adolescent rats and reveal an important divergence from adults in the occurrence of these transients that may result in differential learning about rewards.},

Conspecific rats were systematically presented to male rats and allowed to interact for 30 sec; the males were kept in solitude between each presentation. During these episodes, 125 dopamine concentration transients from 17 rats were detected with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes (peak amplitude, 210 ± 10 nm; duration, 530 ± 20 msec). The frequency of dopamine transients increased sixfold during conspecific episodes compared with solitude. However, the phasic dopamine activity habituated on the second presentation of the conspecifics. When males were allowed to copulate with receptive females, additional dopamine transients were observed at frequencies ∼20\% of those during the previous interaction episodes. A subset of these transients immediately preceded intromission. Overall, phasic dopamine activity appeared to be associated with input from multiple sensory modalities and was followed by a variety of approach and appetitive behaviors, consistent with electrophysiological observations of dopaminergic neuron burst-firing. In summary, (1) dopamine concentration transients occur in awake rats during solitude, in the absence of overt external cues; (2) dopamine transients are significantly more frequent in the presence of a conspecific, although this effect habituates; and (3) dopamine transients are less frequent during copulation than during brief conspecific episodes. These results establish for the first time that transient dopamine fluctuations occur throughout the dorsal and ventral striatum and demonstrate that they are more frequent with salient stimuli that elicit a response behavior.},

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge in developing treatments for autism spectrum disorders is the heterogeneity of the condition. More than one hundred genetic mutations confer high risk for autism, with each individual mutation accounting for only a small fraction of cases1–3. Subsets of risk genes can be grouped into functionally related pathways, most prominently those involving synaptic proteins, translational regulation, and chromatin modifications. To attempt to minimize this genetic complexity, recent therapeutic strategies have focused on the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin4–6, which regulate aspects of social behaviour in mammals7. However, it is unclear whether genetic risk factors predispose individuals to autism as a result of modifications to oxytocinergic signalling. Here we report that an autism-associated mutation in the synaptic adhesion molecule Nlgn3 results in impaired oxytocin signalling in dopaminergic neurons and in altered behavioural responses to social novelty tests in mice. Notably, loss of Nlgn3 is accompanied by a disruption of translation homeostasis in the ventral tegmental area. Treatment of Nlgn3-knockout mice with a new, highly specific, brain-penetrant inhibitor of MAP kinase-interacting kinases resets the translation of mRNA and restores oxytocin signalling and social novelty responses. Thus, this work identifies a convergence between the genetic autism risk factor Nlgn3, regulation of translation, and oxytocinergic signalling. Focusing on such common core plasticity elements might provide a pragmatic approach to overcoming the heterogeneity of autism. Ultimately, this would enable mechanism-based stratification of patient populations to increase the success of therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {The involvement of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens in the formation and maintenance of pair bonds was assessed in a series of experiments using the monogamous prairie vole. We show that dopamine transmission that promotes pair bond formation occurs within the rostral shell of the nucleus accumbens, but not in its core or caudal shell. Within this specific brain region, D1- and D2-like receptor activation produced opposite effects: D1-like activation prevented pair bond formation, whereas D2-like activation facilitated it. After extended cohabitation with a female, male voles showed behavior indicative of pair bond maintenance—namely, selective aggression towards unfamiliar females. These voles also showed a significant upregulation in nucleus accumbens D1-like receptors, and blockade of these receptors abolished selective aggression. Thus, neuroplastic reorganization of the nucleus accumbens dopamine system is responsible for the enduring nature of monogamous pair bonding. Finally, we show that this system may also contribute to species-specific social organization.},

This is generally done by hand— a time consuming, subjective, and expensive process. Recent advances in computer vision enable tracking the pose (posture) of freely-behaving laboratory animals automatically. However, classifying complex social behaviors such as mounting and attack remains technically challenging. Furthermore, the extent to which expert annotators, possibly from different labs, agree on the definitions of these behaviors varies. There is a shortage in the neuroscience community of benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance and reliability of both pose estimation tools and manual and automated behavior scoring.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We introduce the Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS), an automated pipeline for pose estimation and behavior quantification in pairs of freely behaving mice. We compare MARS’s annotations to human annotations and find that MARS’s pose estimation and behavior classification achieve human-level performance. As a by-product we characterize the inter-expert variability in behavior scoring. The two novel datasets used to train MARS were collected from ongoing experiments in social behavior, and identify the main sources of disagreement between annotators. They comprise 30,000 frames of manual annotated mouse poses and over 14 hours of manually annotated behavioral recordings in a variety of experimental preparations. We are releasing this dataset alongside MARS to serve as community benchmarks for pose and behavior systems. Finally, we introduce the Behavior Ensemble and Neural Trajectory Observatory (Bento), a graphical interface that allows users to quickly browse, annotate, and analyze datasets including behavior videos, pose estimates, behavior annotations, audio, and neural recording data. We demonstrate the utility of MARS and Bento in two use cases: a high-throughput behavioral phenotyping study, and exploration of a novel imaging dataset. Together, MARS and Bento provide an end-to-end pipeline for behavior data extraction and analysis, in a package that is user-friendly and easily modifiable.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, it is not known whether these human-defined features capture the most important aspects of behavior for phenotypic comparison or whether they are sufficient to discover new behaviors. Here we show that four basic shapes, or eigenworms, previously described for wild-type worms, also capture mutant shapes, and that this representation can be used to build a dictionary of repetitive behavioral motifs in an unbiased way. By measuring the distance between each individual's behavior and the elements in the motif dictionary, we create a fingerprint that can be used to compare mutants to wild type and to each other. This analysis has revealed phenotypes not previously detected by real-time observation and has allowed clustering of mutants into related groups. Behavioral motifs provide a compact and intuitive representation of behavioral phenotypes.},

Here, we show that the space of shapes adopted by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is low dimensional, with just four dimensions accounting for 95\% of the shape variance. These dimensions provide a quantitative description of worm behavior, and we partially reconstruct “equations of motion” for the dynamics in this space. These dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli. Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively “steering” the worm in real time.},

Further, we discover long-time persistence of orientational memory in the intervals between abrupt turns. Building on recent work demonstrating that C. elegans movements are restricted to a low-dimensional shape space, we construct a map from the dynamics in this shape space to the trajectory of the worm along the agar. We use this connection to illustrate that changes in the continuous dynamics reveal subtle differences in movement strategy that occur among mutants defective in two classes of dopamine receptors.},

Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models.

Although the prelimbic cortex (PL, part of medial prefrontal cortex) has been implicated in social behavior, it is not clear which neurons are relevant or how they contribute. We found that PL contains anatomically and molecularly distinct subpopulations that target three downstream regions that have been implicated in social behavior: the nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. Activation of NAc-projecting PL neurons (PL-NAc), but not the other subpopulations, decreased the preference for a social target. To determine what information PL-NAc neurons convey, we selectively recorded from them and found that individual neurons were active during social investigation, but only in specific spatial locations. Spatially specific manipulation of these neurons bidirectionally regulated the formation of a social-spatial association. Thus, the unexpected combination of social and spatial information within the PL-NAc may contribute to social behavior by supporting social-spatial learning.},

Here, we record bulk and cellular neural activity in the direct and indirect pathways of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express action sequences. These experiments reveal that DLS neurons systematically encode information about the identity and ordering of sub-second 3D behavioral motifs; this encoding is facilitated by fast-timescale decorrelations between the direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, lesioning the DLS prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors. By characterizing naturalistic behavior at neural timescales, these experiments identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics built from complementary pathway dynamics, support a role for DLS in constructing meaningful behavioral sequences, and suggest models for how actions are sculpted over time.},

Restraining or restricting the environment of the animal can simplify automatic behavior quantification, but it can also degrade the quality or alter important aspects of behavior.

These "recurrent" switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS models fail to do.

However, we find that this approach still suffers when the frequency of available labels varies between training sequences. Finally, we introduce a unified objective inspired by teacher-forcing and show that this approach is robust to variable length supervision. We call the resulting method caffeinated wake-sleep (CWS) to emphasize its additional dependence on real data.

	abstract = {Understanding movies and stories requires maintaining a high-level situation model that abstracts away from perceptual details to describe the location, characters, actions, and causal relationships of the currently unfolding event. These models are built not only from information present in the current narrative, but also from prior knowledge about schematic event scripts, which describe typical event sequences encountered throughout a lifetime. We analyzed fMRI data from 44 human subjects (male and female) presented with 16 three-minute stories, consisting of four schematic events drawn from two different scripts (eating at a restaurant or going through the airport). Aside from this shared script structure, the stories varied widely in terms of their characters and storylines, and were presented in two highly dissimilar formats (audiovisual clips or spoken narration). One group was presented with the stories in an intact temporal sequence, while a separate control group was presented with the same events in scrambled order. Regions including the posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and superior frontal gyrus exhibited schematic event patterns that generalized across stories, subjects, and modalities. Patterns in mPFC were also sensitive to overall script structure, with temporally scrambled events evoking weaker schematic representations. Using a Hidden Markov Model, patterns in these regions predicted the script (restaurant vs airport) of unlabeled data with high accuracy and were used to temporally align multiple stories with a shared script. These results extend work on the perception of controlled, artificial schemas in human and animal experiments to naturalistic perception of complex narratives.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In almost all situations we encounter in our daily lives, we are able to draw on our schematic knowledge about what typically happens in the world to better perceive and mentally represent our ongoing experiences. In contrast to previous studies that investigated schematic cognition using simple, artificial associations, we measured brain activity from subjects watching movies and listening to stories depicting restaurant or airport experiences. Our results reveal a network of brain regions that is sensitive to the shared temporal structure of these naturalistic situations. These regions abstract away from the particular details of each story, activating a representation of the general type of situation being perceived.},

Two striatal projection systems--so-called direct and indirect pathways--form the functional backbone of the basal ganglia circuit. Twenty years ago, investigators proposed that the striatum's ability to use dopamine (DA) rise and fall to control action selection was due to the segregation of D(1) and D(2) DA receptors in direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons. Although this hypothesis sparked a debate, the evidence that has accumulated since then clearly supports this model. Recent advances in the means of marking neural circuits with optical or molecular reporters have revealed a clear-cut dichotomy between these two cell types at the molecular, anatomical, and physiological levels. The contrast provided by these studies has provided new insights into how the striatum responds to fluctuations in DA signaling and how diseases that alter this signaling change striatal function.},

	abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are well known for their strong responses to rewards and their critical role in positive motivation. It has become increasingly clear, however, that dopamine neurons also transmit signals related to salient but nonrewarding experiences such as aversive and alerting events. Here we review recent advances in understanding the reward and nonreward functions of dopamine. Based on this data, we propose that dopamine neurons come in multiple types that are connected with distinct brain networks and have distinct roles in motivational control. Some dopamine neurons encode motivational value, supporting brain networks for seeking, evaluation, and value learning. Others encode motivational salience, supporting brain networks for orienting, cognition, and general motivation. Both types of dopamine neurons are augmented by an alerting signal involved in rapid detection of potentially important sensory cues. We hypothesize that these dopaminergic pathways for value, salience, and alerting cooperate to support adaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {Social behaviours in species as diverse as honey bees and humans promote group survival but often come at some cost to the individual. Although reinforcement of adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core, where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation to the nucleus accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus accumbens 5-HT1B receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens, a mechanistic insight with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism.},

	abstract = {Given recent experimental results suggesting that neural circuits may evolve through multiple firing states, we develop a framework for estimating state-dependent neural response properties from spike train data. We modify the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to incorporate stimulus-driven, non-Poisson point-process observations. For maximal flexibility, we allow external, time-varying stimuli and the neurons' own spike histories to drive both the spiking behavior in each state and the transitioning behavior between states. We employ an appropriately modified expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The expectation step is solved by the standard forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. The maximization step reduces to a set of separable concave optimization problems if the model is restricted slightly. We first test our algorithm on simulated data and are able to fully recover the parameters used to generate the data and accurately recapitulate the sequence of hidden states. We then apply our algorithm to a recently published data set in which the observed neuronal ensembles displayed multistate behavior and show that inclusion of spike history information significantly improves the fit of the model. Additionally, we show that a simple reformulation of the state space of the underlying Markov chain allows us to implement a hybrid half-multistate, half-histogram model that may be more appropriate for capturing the complexity of certain data sets than either a simple HMM or a simple peristimulus time histogram model alone.},

The dynamics of neural activity shed light on how organisms process sensory information and generate motor behavior. Here, we study these dynamics using optical recordings of neural activity in the nematode C. elegans. To understand these data, we develop state space models that decompose neural time-series into segments with simple, linear dynamics. We incorporate these models into a hierarchical framework that combines partial recordings from many worms to learn shared structure, while still allowing for individual variability. This framework reveals latent states of population neural activity, along with the discrete behavioral states that govern dynamics in this state space. We ﬁnd stochastic transition patterns between discrete states and see that transition probabilities are determined by both current brain activity and sensory cues. Our methods automatically recover transition times that closely match manual labels of different behaviors, such as forward crawling, reversals, and turns. Finally, the resulting model can simulate neural data, faithfully capturing salient patterns of whole brain dynamics seen in real data.},

Here, we examine thermotactic behavior of the Drosophila melanogaster larva using a tracking microscope to study individual larval movements on defined temperature gradients. We discover that larval thermotaxis involves a larger repertoire of strategies than navigation in smaller organisms such as motile bacteria and Caenorhabditis elegans. Beyond regulating run length (i.e., biasing a random walk), the Drosophila melanogaster larva also regulates the size and direction of turns to achieve and maintain favorable orientations. Thus, the sharp turns in a larva's trajectory represent decision points for selecting new directions of forward movement. The larva uses the same strategies to move up temperature gradients during positive thermotaxis and to move down temperature gradients during negative thermotaxis. Disrupting positive thermotaxis by inactivating cold-sensitive neurons in the larva's terminal organ weakens all regulation of turning decisions, suggesting that information from one set of temperature sensors is used to regulate all aspects of turning decisions. The Drosophila melanogaster larva performs thermotaxis by biasing stochastic turning decisions on the basis of temporal variations in thermosensory input, thereby augmenting the likelihood of heading toward favorable temperatures at all times.},

The aim of this program is causal explanation through neural manipulations that allow testing of necessity and sufficiency claims. We argue, however, that another equally important approach seeks an alternative form of understanding through careful theoretical and experimental decomposition of behavior. Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering component processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implementation of behavior is best investigated after such behavioral work. Thus, we advocate a more pluralistic notion of neuroscience when it comes to the brain-behavior relationship: behavioral work provides understanding, whereas neural interventions test causality.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung Ich habe in diesem Aufsatz kurz anzudeuten versucht, was meiner Ansicht nach das Wesentliche in Fragestellung und Methode der Ethologie ist und weshalb wir in Konrad Lorenz den Begründer moderner Ethologie erblicken. Hierbei habe ich vielleicht das Arbeitsgebiet der Ethologie weiter gefaßt, als unter Ethologen gebräuchlich ist. Wenn man aber die vielartige Arbeit jener Forscher übersieht, die sich Ethologen nennen, ist man zu dieser weiten Fassung geradezu gezwungen. Ich habe in meiner Darstellung weder Vollständigkeit noch Gleichgewicht angestrebt und, um zur Fortführung des Gesprächs anzuregen, ruhig meine Steckenpferde geritten, vor allem das Verhältnis zwischen Ethologie und Physiologie, die Gefahr der Vernachlässigung der Frage der Arterhaltung, Fragen der Methodik der ontogenetischen Forschung, und Aufgaben und Methoden der Evolutionsforschung. Bei der Einschätzung des Anteils, den Lorenz an der Entwicklung der Ethologie genommen hat und noch nimmt, habe ich als seinen Hauptbeitrag den bezeichnet, daß er uns gezeigt hat, wie man bewährtes “biologisches Denken” folgerichtig auf Verhalten anwenden kann. Daß er dabei an die Arbeit seiner Vorgänger angeknüpft hat, ist nicht mehr verwunderlich, als daß jeder Vater selbst einen Vater hat. Insbesondere scheint mir das Wesentliche an Lorenz‘ Arbeit zu sein, daß er klar gesehen hat, daß Verhaltensweisen Teile von “Organen”, von Systemen der Arterhaltung sind; daß ihre Verursachung genau so exakt untersucht werden kann wie die gleich welcher anderer Lebensvorgänge, daß ihr arterhaltender Wert ebenso systematisch und exakt aufweisbar ist wie ihre Verursachung, daß Verhaltensontogenie in grundsätzlich gleicher Weise erforscht werden kann wie die Ontogenie der Form und daß die Erforschung der Verhaltensevolution der Untersuchung der Strukturevolution parallel geht. Und obwohl Lorenz ein riesiges Tatsachenmaterial gesammelt hat, ist die Ethologie doch noch mehr durch seine Fragestellung und durch kühne Hypothesen gefördert als durch eigene Nachprüfung dieser Hypothesen. Ohne den Wert solcher Nachprüfung zu unterschätzen — ohne die es natürlich keine Weiterentwicklung gäbe — möchte ich doch behaupten, daß die durch Nachprüfung notwendig gewordenen Modifikationen neben der Leistung des ursprünglichen Ansatzes vergleichsweise unbedeutend sind. Nebenbei sei auch daran erinnert, daß eine der vielen heilsamen Nachwirkungen der Lorenzschen Arbeit das wachsende Interesse ist, das die Humanpsychologie der Ethologie entgegenbringt - ein erster Ansatz einer Entwicklung, deren Tragweite wir noch kaum übersehen können. Am Schluß noch eine Bemerkung zur Terminologie. Ich habe hier das Wort “Ethologie” auf einen Riesenkomplex von Wissenschaften angewandt, von denen manche, wie Psychologie und Physiologie, schon längst anerkannte Namen tragen. Das heißt natürlich nicht, daß ich den Namen Ethologie für dieses ganze Gebiet vorschlagen will; das wäre geschichtlich einfach falsch, weil das Wort historisch nur die Arbeit einer kleinen Gruppe von Zoologen kennzeichnet. Der Name ist natürlich gleichgültig; worauf es mir vor allem ankommt, ist darzutun, daß wir das Zusammenwachsen vieler Einzeldisziplinen zu einer vielumfassenden Wissenschaft erleben, für die es nur einen richtigen Namen gibt: “Verhaltensbiologie”. Selbstverständlich ist diese synthetische Entwicklung nicht die Arbeit eines Mannes oder gar die der Ethologen. Sie ist die Folge einer allgemeinen Neigung, Brücken zwischen verwandten Wissenschaften zu schlagen, einer Neigung, die sich in vielen Disziplinen entwickelt hat. Unter den Zoologen ist es Lorenz, der hierzu am meisten beigetragen und zudem manche Nachbardisziplinen stärker beeinflußt hat als irgendein anderer. Ich bin sogar davon überzeugt, daß diese Einwirkungen auf Nachbarwissenschaften noch lange anhalten werden und daß die Verhaltensbiologie erst am Anfang ihrer Ontogenie steht.},

	abstract = {Most behaviors such as making tea are not stereotypical but have an obvious structure. However, analytical methods to objectively extract structure from non-stereotyped behaviors are immature. In this study, we analyze the locomotion of fruit flies and show that this non-stereotyped behavior is well-described by a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM). HHMM shows that a fly's locomotion can be decomposed into a few locomotor features, and odors modulate locomotion by altering the time a fly spends performing different locomotor features. Importantly, although all flies in our dataset use the same set of locomotor features, individual flies vary considerably in how often they employ a given locomotor feature, and how this usage is modulated by odor. This variation is so large that the behavior of individual flies is best understood as being grouped into at least three to five distinct clusters, rather than variations around an average fly.},

	abstract = {Social interaction is a complex behavior essential for many species and is impaired in major neuropsychiatric disorders. Pharmacological studies have implicated certain neurotransmitter systems in social behavior, but circuit-level understanding of endogenous neural activity during social interaction is lacking. We therefore developed and applied a new methodology, termed fiber photometry, to optically record natural neural activity in genetically and connectivity-defined projections to elucidate the real-time role of specified pathways in mammalian behavior. Fiber photometry revealed that activity dynamics of a ventral tegmental area (VTA)-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) projection could encode and predict key features of social, but not novel object, interaction. Consistent with this observation, optogenetic control of cells specifically contributing to this projection was sufficient to modulate social behavior, which was mediated by type 1 dopamine receptor signaling downstream in the NAc. Direct observation of deep projection-specific activity in this way captures a fundamental and previously inaccessible dimension of mammalian circuit dynamics.},

	abstract = {Modern recording techniques enable large-scale measurements of neural activity in a variety of model organisms. The dynamics of neural activity shed light on how organisms process sensory information and generate motor behavior. Here, we study these dynamics using optical recordings of neural activity in the nematode C. elegans. To understand these data, we develop state space models that decompose neural time-series into segments with simple, linear dynamics. We incorporate these models into a hierarchical framework that combines partial recordings from many worms to learn shared structure, while still allowing for individual variability. This framework reveals latent states of population neural activity, along with the discrete behavioral states that govern dynamics in this state space. We ﬁnd stochastic transition patterns between discrete states and see that transition probabilities are determined by both current brain activity and sensory cues. Our methods automatically recover transition times that closely match manual labels of different behaviors, such as forward crawling, reversals, and turns. Finally, the resulting model can simulate neural data, faithfully capturing salient patterns of whole brain dynamics seen in real data.},

Conventional ethological approaches to social behavior are fraught with challenges including bias, significant human effort and temporal accuracy. Here we show proof of principle that machine learning can be applied to laboratory tests of social decision making. Rats underwent social novelty preference tests which were scored both by hand and again by a convolutional neural network generated in the DeepLabCut computer vision package of Mathis and colleagues. The CNN generated temporally (30Hz) and locally ({\textless}5pixels) accurate identification of rat nose, eye and ear positions which were then used to compute social interaction and topography heat maps. In sum, hand- and computer-scoring were strongly correlated, and each identified significant preferences to interact with novel conspecifics which sets the stage for applying DeepLabCut analysis to other types of social interaction in the future.},

An off-the-shelf composite infrared (IR) range camera was adopted to grab high-resolution depth images (640×480×2048pixels at 20Hz) in our system for automated behavior analysis. For the inherent 3D structure of the depth images, we developed a compact algorithm to reconstruct the locomotion and body behavior with superior temporal and solid spatial resolution. Since the range camera operates in the IR spectrum, interference from the visible light spectrum did not affect the tracking performance. The accuracy of our system was 98.1±3.2\%. We also validated the system, which yielded strong correlation with automated and manual tracking. Meanwhile, the system replicates a detailed dynamic rat model in virtual space, which demonstrates the movements of the extremities of the body and locomotion in detail on varied terrain.},

Here we present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. Remarkably, even when only a small number of frames are labeled ({\textasciitilde}200), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.},

Currently, most studies of social behavior rely on labor-intensive methods such as manual annotation of individual video frames. These methods are susceptible to experimenter bias and have limited throughput. To understand the neural circuits underlying social behavior, scalable and objective tracking methods are needed. We present a hardware/software system that combines 3D videography, deep learning, physical modeling and GPU-accelerated robust optimization. Our system is capable of fully automatic multi-animal tracking during naturalistic social interactions and allows for simultaneous electrophys-iological recordings.

Measuring behavior quantitatively, at high-resolution and in an automated fashion provides valuable information about the underlying neural circuit computation. Accordingly, computer-vision applications for animal tracking are becoming a key complementary toolkit to genetic, molecular and electrophysiological characterization in systems neuroscience. Methodology/Principal Findings We present Sensory Orientation Software (SOS) to measure behavior and infer sensory experience correlates. SOS is a simple and versatile system to track body posture and motion of single animals in two-dimensional environments. In the presence of a sensory landscape, tracking the trajectory of the animal's sensors and its postural evolution provides a quantitative framework to study sensorimotor integration. To illustrate the utility of SOS, we examine the orientation behavior of fruit fly larvae in response to odor, temperature and light gradients. We show that SOS is suitable to carry out high-resolution behavioral tracking for a wide range of organisms including flatworms, fishes and mice. Conclusions/Significance Our work contributes to the growing repertoire of behavioral analysis tools for collecting rich and fine-grained data to draw and test hypothesis about the functioning of the nervous system. By providing open-access to our code and documenting the software design, we aim to encourage the adaptation of SOS by a wide community of non-specialists to their particular model organism and questions of interest.},

It is a programme rather than an exhaustive treatise of results. The author's presentation has a dual aim. First, it is intended to call the attention of Anglo-American workers to research done on the European continent. Second, this book is an attempt at an organization of the ethological problems into a coherent whole. This applies especially to the problems of the causes underlying instinctive behaviour. These problems are dealt with in Chapters I to V inclusive, in which a systematic treatment is attempted. The author's principal aims in this part have been: (1) to elucidate the hierarchical nature of the system of causal relations, and to stress the paramount importance of recognizing the different levels of integration; and (2) to bring ethology into contact with neurophysiology. Chapters VI, VII, and VIII, dealing respectively with ontogeny, adaptiveness, and evolution, should not be considered attempts at such a systematic treatment. The fragmentary and more or less unbalanced nature of these chapters are due to the unsatisfactory state of these more or less neglected fields of ethology.

An open question is whether and how emergent properties may arise across brains of socially interacting individuals to influence social decisions. By simultaneously performing microendoscopic calcium imaging in pairs of socially interacting mice, we find that animals exhibit interbrain correlations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex that are dependent on ongoing social interaction. Activity synchrony arises from two neuronal populations that separately encode one’s own behaviors and those of the social partner. Strikingly, interbrain correlations predict future social interactions as well as dominance relationships in a competitive context. Together, our study provides conclusive evidence for interbrain synchrony in rodents, uncovers how synchronization arises from activity at the single-cell level, and presents a role for interbrain neural activity coupling as a property of multi-animal systems in coordinating and sustaining social interactions between individuals.},

	abstract = {Summary Humans are a “social animal” and it is our social attachments that we live for. Recent studies have begun to reveal the common neural mechanisms that underlie specific social attachments. Apart from pharmacological studies in maternal monkeys and recent imaging studies in humans, most studies have so far been done in non-primate mammals. Infant–mother attachment. Studies in chick show that during imprinting — when a chick develops an enduring selectivity for following its mother — a long-term memory is formed, entailing changes in the postsynaptic structure of specific cortical regions of the brain. By contrast, rat pups develop maternal recognition through olfactory learning. At this time, no specific cortical region of the pup brain has been identified as important. Maternal–infant attachment. In the rat, many of the same neuroendocrine factors — oestrogen and progesterone — that are associated with pregnancy and lactation are also critical for the onset of maternal behaviour. The neuropeptides prolactin and oxytocin also have a central role. The effects of oxtocin might be mediated through the ventral tegmental area and the medial preoptic area. Olfactory learning. In sheep, selective maternal behaviour can be instigated by vaginocervical stimulation, which stimulates the release of oxytocin. Furthermore, injection of oxytocin into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus can induce maternal acceptance of the lamb. The maternal ewe's identification of her lamb is accompanied by a robust increase in extracellular concentrations of glutamate and GABA within the olfactory bulb and a reorganization of synapses. Adult–adult pair bond formation. In monogamous prairie voles, oxytocin and vasopressin seem to be necessary and sufficient for pair-bond formation. Neither peptide has a notable effect in the non-monogamous montane vole. Differences in behaviour might be due to differences in the expression patterns of the receptors for these factors. Differences in the promoter regions of these receptor genes have been implictaed in these species differences in receptor distribution and behaviour.},

Studies in humans and other primates have pointed to several structures that play a key role in guiding social behaviors: the amygdala, ventromedial frontal cortices, and right somatosensory-related cortex, among others. These structures appear to mediate between perceptual representations of socially relevant stimuli, such as the sight of conspecifics, and retrieval of knowledge (or elicitation of behaviors) that such stimuli can trigger. Current debates concern the extent to which social cognition draws upon processing specialized for social information, and the relative contributions made to social cognition by innate and acquired knowledge.},

Social learning includes a wide array of behaviors such as imitation, observational learning of novel foraging techniques, peer or parental influences on individual preferences, as well as outright teaching. These processes are believed to underlie an important part of cultural variation among human populations and may also explain intraspecific variation in behavior between geographically distinct populations of animals. Recent neurobiological studies have begun to uncover the neural basis of social learning. Here we review experimental evidence from the past few decades showing that social learning is a widespread set of skills present in multiple animal species. In mammals, the temporoparietal junction, the dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the anterior cingulate gyrus, appear to play critical roles in social learning. Birds, fish and insects also learn from others, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We discuss the evolutionary implications of these findings and highlight the importance of emerging animal models that permit precise modification of neural circuit function for elucidating the neural basis of social learning.},

	abstract = {Complex animal behaviors are likely built from simpler modules, but their systematic identification in mammals remains a significant challenge. Here we use depth imaging to show that 3D mouse pose dynamics are structured at the sub-second timescale. Computational modeling of these fast dynamics effectively describes mouse behavior as a series of reused and stereotyped modules with defined transition probabilities. We demonstrate this combined 3D imaging and machine learning method can be used to unmask potential strategies employed by the brain to adapt to the environment, to capture both predicted and previously hidden phenotypes caused by genetic or neural manipulations, and to systematically expose the global structure of behavior within an experiment. This work reveals that mouse body language is built from identifiable components and is organized in a predictable fashion; deciphering this language establishes an objective framework for characterizing the influence of environmental cues, genes and neural activity on behavior.

	abstract = {For many organisms, searching for relevant targets such as food or mates entails active, strategic sampling of the environment. Finding odorous targets may be the most ancient search problem that motile organisms evolved to solve. While chemosensory navigation has been well characterized in micro-organisms and invertebrates, spatial olfaction in vertebrates is poorly understood. We have established an olfactory search assay in which freely-moving mice navigate noisy concentration gradients of airborne odor. Mice solve this task using concentration gradient cues and do not require stereo olfaction for performance. During task performance, respiration and nose movement are synchronized with tens of milliseconds precision. This synchrony is present during trials and largely absent during inter-trial intervals, suggesting that sniﬀ-synchronized nose movement is a strategic behavioral state rather than simply a constant accompaniment to fast breathing. To investigate the spatiotemporal structure of these active sensing movements, we used machine learning methods to parse motion trajectories into elementary movement motifs. Motifs fall into two clusters, which correspond to investigation and approach states. Investigation motifs lock precisely to sniﬃng, such that the individual motifs preferentially occur at speciﬁc phases of the sniﬀ cycle. This work clariﬁes sensorimotor strategies for mouse olfactory search and guides ongoing work into the underlying neural mechanisms.},

There is a well-known correlation between arousal and neuronal activity in the brain. However, it is unclear how these general effects are reflected on a local scale. Engel et al. recorded from higher visual areas in behaving monkeys and discovered a new principle of cortical state fluctuations. A special type of electrodes revealed that the state changes affected neuronal excitability across all layers of the neocortex. When the animals attended to a stimulus, the vigorous spiking states became longer and the faint spiking states became shorter. These states correlated with fluctuations in the local field potential. A sophisticated computational model of the state changes fitted a two-state model of neuronal responsiveness.
Science, this issue p. 1140
Neocortical activity is permeated with endogenously generated fluctuations, but how these dynamics affect goal-directed behavior remains a mystery. We found that ensemble neural activity in primate visual cortex spontaneously fluctuated between phases of vigorous (On) and faint (Off) spiking synchronously across cortical layers. These On-Off dynamics, reflecting global changes in cortical state, were also modulated at a local scale during selective attention. Moreover, the momentary phase of local ensemble activity predicted behavioral performance. Our results show that cortical state is controlled locally within a cortical map according to cognitive demands and reveal the impact of these local changes in cortical state on goal-directed behavior.
Brain state is controlled locally according to cognitive demands.
