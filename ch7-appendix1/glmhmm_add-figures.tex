    \caption[Optogenetic inhibition of DMS pathways is effective, generating little post-inhibitory rebound, nor excitation during the inhibition period]{\textbf{Optogenetic inhibition of DMS pathways is effective, generating little post-inhibitory rebound, nor excitation during the inhibition period.} (a) Schematic of viral delivery of AAV5-eF1a-DIO-NpHR to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of A2a-Cre or D1R-Cre mice. (b,i) Schematic of electrophysiological recording and laser delivery (532-nm, 5-mW) to the DMS in awake, head-fixed mice ambulating on a running wheel. (b,ii) Example recording electrode tracks and cre-dependent NpHR expression in an A2a-Cre mouse targeting the indirect pathway of the DMS. (b,iii) As in b,ii but in a D1R-Cre mouse targeting the DMS direct pathway. (b,iv) Schematic of silicon optrode recording tip, including tapered optical fiber coupled to a 32-channel silicon probe. (c) Two example peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) (top) and raster plots of trial-by-trial spike times (bottom) from single neurons recorded from the DMS of an A2a-Cre mouse. Inset at top displays average spike waveform (black) and 100 randomly sampled spike waveforms (grey) for each neuron. A trial consisted of 5-s without laser (pre, -5 to 0-s), 5-s of 532-nm light (5-mW) delivery (on, 0 to 5-s), followed by a 10-s ITI (40 trials per recording site). The first 2-s following laser offset (post, 5-7-s) was used to assess post-inhibitory effects. (d) Left: Histogram of change in average firing rate (on-pre, Hz) for all neurons (n = 60) recorded from the DMS of A2a-Cre mice (n = 3). Colors indicate non-significant (black, n = 38 neurons), significantly decreased }

  \contcaption{(red, n = 18 neurons) or increased (green, n = 4 neurons) changes in firing rate determined via paired, two-tailed signrank comparison of average across-trial baseline (pre) or laser (on) firing rates. A Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold was used to account for multiple neuron comparisons (p < 0.00083, or p = 0.05/60 neuron comparisons). Right: same as left but for change in firing rate (post-pre, Hz): non-significant (n = 55 neurons), significantly decreased (n = 4) or increased (n = 1). Insets display pie-chart summaries of the proportion of non-significant (black unfilled), significantly decreased (red) or increased (green) neurons. (e) Left: Mean +/- SEM z-scored firing rate across all non-significantly modulated on vs pre (black, n = 38) or significantly decreased on vs pre (red, n = 18) neurons recorded from A2a-Cre mice. Right: same as left but for all non-significantly modulated post vs pre (black, n = 55) or significantly decreased post vs pre (red, n = 4) neurons. (f) Same as c but for example neurons recorded from the DMS of D1R-Cre mice. (g) Same as d but for all neurons (n = 50) recorded from the DMS of D1R-Cre mice (n = 2). Left (on-pre): non-significant (n = 27), significantly decreased (n = 21), or increased (n = 2). Right (post-pre): non-significant (n = 46), significantly decreased (n = 2) or increased (n = 2). A Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold was used to account for multiple neuron comparisons (p < 0.001, or p = 0.05/50 neuron comparisons).
