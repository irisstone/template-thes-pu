Mice were anesthetized with a 0.05 mL injection of Euthasol (i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by fixation with 4\% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Whole brains with intact fiberoptic implants were post-fixed in 4\% PFA for 1-3 days, followed by brain dissection and another 24 hours of post-fixation in PFA. For optogenetic experiments, brains were then transferred to PBS for coronal sectioning (50 µM) on a vibratome. Viral expression and fiberoptic placements were assessed under slide-scanning (NanoZoomer, Hamamatsu) or single slide (Leica) epifluorescent microscopes (Supplementary Fig. 6). For FISH experiments, post-fixation dissected brains were transferred through a sucrose gradient: 10\% sucrose in PBS for 6-8 hours, 20\% sucrose in PBS overnight, and 30\% sucrose in PBS overnight. Coronal sections (18 µM) containing the DMS and NAc were made using a cryostat, mounted uncoverslipped on Superfrost plus slides (Fisher), and stored at -80° prior to the FISH protocol. After the FISH protocol, tile-scanning and cellular resolution images of cover-slipped slides were acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8).
